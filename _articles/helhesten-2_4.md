## Background

Published on Christmas Eve 1943, this issue appeared during an increasingly tense period of the occupation. The August 1943 uprising had marked a turning point in Danish resistance, and the journal continued to serve as a space for cultural dissent through its celebration of creative freedom and humanistic values.

## Cover Design

Ejler Bille (1910–2004) designed the cover for this issue. As one of the founding members of the Helhesten group, Bille was a central figure in Danish abstract art. He had studied in Paris before the war and by 1940 had developed a distinctive style characterized by dense conglomerations of colour patches and mask-like forms.

Bille had initially been cautious about the journal's provocative name. In January 1941, he wrote to Jorn worrying that "there is something anarchistic in the devastation with 'helhesten' that I do not think is fitting for Marxists," and warned against advertising the journal too widely for fear of censorship. Nevertheless, he remained a committed contributor throughout the journal's existence.

## Key Contents

### "Henry Heerup" by Dan Sterup-Hansen

Dan Sterup-Hansen contributed a substantial profile of Henry Heerup, one of the most distinctive artists in the Helhesten circle. In the essay, Sterup-Hansen compared Heerup's working method to that of Hans Christian Andersen:

{% capture sterup_quote %}
Heerup stands with his feet firmly on the ground; but from the heart and up over his head he lives in the land of fantasy. Just as H.C. Andersen finds enough reality in a darning needle, a top, and a ball to create a large and nuanced expression of life, so Heerup creates from the stone from the field, the colours from the tube, the tin can, the branch, and the razor blades his reality-strong works, which speak as strongly to us through the way they are made as through what they represent.

### "Stylistics" (*Stilarter*) by Asger Jorn

Jorn contributed a theoretical article on stylistics, continuing his engagement with questions of art history and aesthetic theory. In the essay, he called for a comprehensive style history "based on the development of living life," critiquing works that failed to engage with the vital dimensions of artistic expression.

### "Abstract Art or Fantasy Art—A Painter's Work" by Carl-Henning Pedersen

Carl-Henning Pedersen's important essay articulated the group's preferred term "fantasy art" (*fantasikunst*) over "abstract art":

{% capture pedersen_quote %}
What is common to the artists called "abstract" is that they all work from the free world of fantasy. A better common designation for this kind of art is "fantasy art," such a word will show the connection to primitive and oriental art and to the free creative play of children. As long as we use the word "abstract," people think that the artists have invented a new artistic language that one must learn, instead of recognizing that "fantasy art" works from something central in human beings, something that everyone can understand and feel without prior knowledge.

### "Junkman & Junk Model" (*Skraldemand & Skraldemodel*) by Henry Heerup

Heerup contributed a text elaborating his artistic philosophy of working with discarded materials—"junk art" or *skraldekunst*—which would become one of his signature approaches.
