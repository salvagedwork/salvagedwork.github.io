At the end of the sixties, Asger Jorn, in his efforts to create a new art museum in Silkeborg, asked his friend Jean Dubuffet for permission to erect a large sculpture of his in front of the museum. Jean Dubuffet approved the project. After the death of Jorn, the plans for the construction of the existing museum had to be modified and Dubuffet again satisfied the museum's proposals by accepting that his sketch for a large ceramic wall, originally commissioned by the French State in 1965, should be incorporated at the outer facade of the new Silkeborg Museum.

The relief is entitled *Épokhè*. It is a term that belongs to the philosophical language and means "suspension of judgment." The wall measures 4.5 m by 22.5 m. It was realized by the Danish ceramist Erik Nyholm in collaboration with the workshop "Ild og ler" in Jutland.
