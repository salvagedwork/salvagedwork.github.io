This article is part of the [Helhesten](/collection/helhesten/) collection.

## Background

The final double issue of *Helhesten* appeared in November 1944, less than six months before Denmark's liberation on May 5, 1945. The journal ended not because of German censorship but due to accumulated financial debt from its ambitious colour printing during wartime conditions.

As Kerry Greaves notes:

{% capture greaves_quote %}
It was Helhesten's growing financial debt, in fact, and not censorship by the Germans, that led to its closure in 1944. The financial problems led to uneven publication, so that while six issues came out in 1941, just one issue was produced in 1942, three in 1943, and two in 1944.

## Cover Design

Carl-Henning Pedersen (1913–2007) designed the cover for this final issue, bringing the series full circle-he had also designed the cover for the bound Year 1 collection. Pedersen was one of the core Helhesten artists, known for his fantastical imagery populated by birds, suns, and mythological creatures rendered in bright, spontaneous colours. His work exemplified the "fantasy art" approach he had theorized in earlier issues.

## Key Contents

### "The Prophetic Harps" (*De profetiske harper*) by Asger Jorn

Jorn contributed a substantial theoretical essay exploring the relationship between visual art and writing, continuing the journal's investigation of symbolic expression:

{% capture jorn_quote %}
Visual art and writing are the same. A picture is written, and writing is pictures. Just as the fullness of a violin's tone depends on the multitude of overtones that lie behind the actual tone we hear, so the whole range of unconscious associations we have with a sign is the cause of its power.

### "Medieval Wall Paintings" (*Middelalderens kalkmalerier*) by Carl-Henning Pedersen

Pedersen contributed an essay on Danish medieval church frescoes, connecting the journal's interest in contemporary fantasy art to historical precedents in Nordic folk tradition. This continued *Helhesten*'s sustained engagement with prehistoric and medieval Scandinavian visual culture as sources of inspiration for modern art.

### "All Art Should Be Popular" (*Al kunst bør være folkelig*) by Henry Heerup

Heerup's essay articulated the journal's populist ethos, arguing that art should be accessible and meaningful to ordinary people-a position that aligned with the Danish tradition of *folkelighed* (popular belonging) while challenging both academic elitism and Nazi cultural propaganda.

### "Folk Poetry" (*Almuepoesi*) by Jens Sigsgaard

Sigsgaard contributed an essay on vernacular poetry, extending the journal's investigation of popular culture and folk traditions as vital sources for contemporary artistic practice.

### Children's Drawings

    caption="Some of the print inserts in <cite>Helhesten</cite> were drawings made by children, as seen in this print from <cite>Helhesten</cite> year 2, booklets 5-6. The Helhesten artists believed in the ability of children's drawings to convey an uninhibited and uninfluenced sense of realism."

The final issue included children's drawings as print inserts, demonstrating the group's continued commitment to celebrating uninhibited creativity as a model for authentic artistic expression.

## Legacy

Though *Helhesten* ended in 1944, its influence extended far beyond the war years. Many of its core artists-including Jorn, Pedersen, Bille, and Jacobsen-became founding members of the international Cobra movement (1948–1951), which carried forward *Helhesten*'s emphasis on spontaneity, fantasy, and the integration of art with everyday life. The journal's editor, Robert Dahlmann Olsen, edited the first issue of *Cobra* in a format virtually identical to *Helhesten*.

As Guy Atkins writes:

{% capture atkins_quote %}
It is now generally recognized that the artists of the war years were by far the most talented generation of painters and sculptors that Denmark has ever produced.
