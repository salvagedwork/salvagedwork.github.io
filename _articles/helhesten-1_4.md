## Background

The fourth issue of *Helhesten* appeared in October 1941, maintaining the journal's remarkable pace of publication during its first year. This issue deepened the journal's exploration of the theoretical foundations of Danish spontaneous-abstract art while continuing to connect modern practice to historical folk traditions.

## Cover Design

Hans Scherfig (1905–1979) designed the cover for this issue. Scherfig was a Danish painter, illustrator, and author known for his satirical work, naïve painting style, and Communist sympathies. His inclusion among the cover artists reflects *Helhesten*'s embrace of artists across the Danish modernist spectrum-Scherfig was an established figure whose popular illustrations and political engagement aligned with the journal's populist and anti-fascist ethos, even though his style differed from the younger abstract-expressionist core of the group.

## Key Contents

### "Asger Jørgensen" (Profile of Asger Jorn)

Egill Jacobsen contributed a substantial profile of Asger Jorn (then still using his birth name Asger Jørgensen), offering critical insight into Jorn's working methods and aesthetic philosophy. Jacobsen described Jorn's approach to small-scale works:

{% capture jacobsen_quote %}
We must go out into the great cosmic night, not to sleep a heavy dreamless sleep, but out to experience the small beings of drives and desires, as they are in the transition between dream and reality. They move in the rhythm that corresponds to the dreaming state, in the rhythm that leads from dream toward a richer reality.

{% include quote.html text=jacobsen_quote attribution="- Egill Jacobsen, &ldquo;Asger Jørgensen,&rdquo; <em>Helhesten</em> 1, no. 4 (1941)" %}

This text articulated the group's interest in dream states and the unconscious as sources of artistic inspiration-ideas that would later become central to the Cobra movement.

### "E hælhæjst" (The Hell-Horse)

The issue published a poem about the helhest by Steen Steensen Blicher (1782–1848), the Danish national poet best known for his depictions of rural peasant life. The inclusion of Blicher's poem connected the journal's provocative mythological symbol to established Danish literary tradition, demonstrating that the hell-horse was not merely an avant-garde invention but was rooted in centuries of Nordic folklore and poetry.

### "When Children Draw" (*Naar børn tegner*)

Jens Sigsgaard contributed an essay on children's drawings, exploring the uninhibited creativity that the Helhesten artists saw as a model for authentic artistic expression. This interest in children's art was central to the group's philosophy-they believed that children's drawings conveyed an uninfluenced sense of reality that academic training systematically destroyed.

As Kerry Greaves notes, the Helhesten artists' interest in children's art "showed the trend and inspiration in modern art" and highlighted "affinities to primitive and oriental art and to the free creative play of children."

## Artistic Philosophy

The fourth issue continued to develop what Carl-Henning Pedersen had termed "fantasy art" (*fantasikunst*) in the previous issue-art that set out "from something central in people, something which everyone can understand and feel without prior knowledge. Something they themselves have experienced as a child but have forgotten, convinced of the necessity to grow up and follow foolish social traditions."

## The Helhesten Series

*Helhesten* was published over nine issues from April 1941 to November 1944. The journal was illustrated with over fifty original, mostly colour graphic works, and printed in editions of 800.
