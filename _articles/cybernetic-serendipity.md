## Background

The origins of the exhibition can be traced to 1965, when Max Bense visited the ICA during a concrete poetry exhibition curated by Reichardt. When she asked what she should do next, Bense's reply was direct: she should look into computers. It was a timely suggestion. Only months earlier, on 5 February 1965, Bense had opened what is now considered the first exhibition of computer-generated art at his Studiengalerie at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart, showing plotter drawings by Georg Nees. Computer graphics had also been exhibited that year in New York. The field was new enough that its practitioners were almost exclusively scientists and engineers rather than trained artists - a fact that would become one of the exhibition's most interesting features.

Reichardt, who served as Assistant Director of the ICA from 1963 to 1971, began planning the project in autumn 1965. It took three years to secure adequate financial support. She was assisted by Mark Dowson, a freelance electronics and systems design consultant associated with Dr. Gordon Pask and System Research Ltd., who served as technological adviser; Peter Schmidt, a painter with a particular interest in electronic and computer music, as musical adviser; and Franciszka Themerson - the Polish-born London-based painter, illustrator, and theatrical designer - who designed both the exhibition itself and the celebrated catalogue cover. Students from the Bath Academy of Art assisted Themerson with the exhibition installation.

The title paired cybernetics - from the Greek *kybernetes*, meaning steersman, a term first used by Norbert Wiener in 1948 to describe systems of communication and control in complex electronic devices - with serendipity, a word coined by Horace Walpole in 1754 after a legend about three princes of Serendip (the old name for Ceylon) who, in their travels, always found something better than what they were looking for. Through the use of cybernetic devices to make graphics, film, and poems, as well as randomising machines that interacted with the spectator, many such happy discoveries were made.

*Cybernetic Serendipity* opened at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, Nash House, The Mall, London, on 2 August 1968 and ran until 20 October. The exhibition was opened by Tony Benn, then Minister of Technology under Harold Wilson's Labour government - a fitting political patron for a show staged during what Wilson had promised would be a Britain "forged in the white heat" of technological revolution. Estimates of total visitors ranged from 44,000 to 60,000, though the ICA did not maintain precise counts. The *Evening Standard* captured the show's ecumenical appeal by asking where else in London one could take "a hippy, a computer programmer, a ten-year-old schoolboy and guarantee that each would be perfectly happy for an hour."

The exhibition brought together approximately 325 participants from many countries: an estimated 43 artists, composers, and poets alongside 87 engineers, computer scientists, and philosophers, with the rest comprising technicians and other contributors. It was organised into three sections:

1. Computer-generated graphics, computer-animated films, computer-composed and -played music, and computer poems and texts
2. Cybernetic devices as works of art, cybernetic environments, remote-control robots, and painting machines
3. Machines demonstrating the uses of computers and an environment dealing with the history of cybernetics

{% capture cs_intro %}
The idea behind this venture... is to show some of the creative forms engendered by technology. The aim is to present an area of activity which manifests artists' involvement with science, and the scientists' involvement with the arts; also, to show the links between the random systems employed by artists, composers and poets, and those involved with the making and the use of cybernetic devices.

Cybernetic Serendipity deals with possibilities rather than achievements... [t]here are no heroic claims to be made because computers have so far neither revolutionized music, nor art, nor poetry, in the same way that they have revolutionized science.

...no visitor to the exhibition, unless he reads all the notes relating to all the works, will know whether he is looking at something made by an artist, engineer, mathematician, or architect. Nor is it particularly important to know the background of the makers of the various robots, machines and graphics - it will not alter their impact, although it might make us see them differently.

Among the participants were Nicolas Schöffer, who exhibited his *Cybernetic Light Tower*; Gordon Pask, whose *Colloquy of Mobiles* (1968) consisted of large interacting mobiles that allowed viewers to join the conversation; Jean Tinguely, who showed two of his painting machines; Nam June Paik, represented by *Robot K-456* and televisions with distorted images; Edward Ihnatowicz, whose biomorphic hydraulic *Sound Activated Mobile (SAM)* turned toward sounds made by visitors in a remarkably lifelike manner; Bruce Lacey, who contributed his radio-controlled robots including *ROSA BOSOM*; and Wen-Ying Tsai, who presented interactive cybernetic sculptures of vibrating stainless-steel rods with stroboscopic light and audio feedback control. Peter Zinovieff lent part of his studio equipment, allowing visitors to sing or whistle a tune into a microphone, which his equipment would then use to improvise a piece of music. Several machines drew patterns that visitors could take away, or involved them in games.

Other participants included Max Bense, Nicholas Negroponte, Earle Brown, John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Iannis Xenakis, Liliane Lijn, Gustav Metzger, Charles Csuri, the Computer Technique Group of Japan, and A. Michael Noll of Bell Telephone Laboratories, who exhibited a well-known experiment in which he had analysed a 1917 Mondrian painting and produced random computer graphics using the same compositional parameters - the majority of viewers preferred the computer version and misidentified the Mondrian as machine-made.

A scaled-down version of the exhibition subsequently toured to the Corcoran Gallery of Art (Corcoran Annex) in Washington, D.C., from 16 July to 31 August 1969, and to the newly opened Exploratorium in San Francisco from 1 November to 18 December 1969. Several pieces were purchased by the Exploratorium in 1971, some of which remained on display for decades. Remaining exhibition materials were transferred to the Kawasaki City Museum in Japan when Reichardt left the ICA in 1971.

### Legacy

The exhibition proved to be a catalyst for institutional developments in computer art. The Computer Arts Society (CAS) was founded in 1968 by three individuals closely connected to the show - cybernetician George Mallen, ICL programmer Alan Sutcliffe (both participants in the exhibition), and architect John Lansdown. Operating as a special interest group of the British Computer Society, CAS fostered computer arts activity through exhibitions, workshops, and its bulletin *PAGE*, initially edited by Gustav Metzger, another exhibitor at *Cybernetic Serendipity*.

In 2014, the ICA held a retrospective documentation exhibition, *Cybernetic Serendipity: A Documentation*, with documents, photographs, press reviews, and a discussion featuring Peter Zinovieff. The Victoria and Albert Museum marked the 50th anniversary in 2018 with *Chance and Control: Art in the Age of Computers*, which included many works by artists from the original show.

## Exhibition Catalogue

The catalogue took the form of a special issue of *Studio International* magazine, numbering just over 100 pages with approximately 300 images. The first edition was published in July 1968; a revised second edition appeared in September of the same year. The cover was designed by Franciszka Themerson, incorporating computer graphics from the exhibition. The colour frontispiece reproduced a computer graphic by John C. Mott-Smith, made by time-lapse photography successively exposed through coloured filters of an oscilloscope connected to a computer. Laid into copies of the special issue were four separate leaves entitled "Cybernetic Serendipity Music," each providing a programme for one of eight tapes of music played during the show - information apparently not available in time to be included in the printed issue.

In 1969, Frederick A. Praeger Publishers of New York and Washington, D.C. issued a cloth-bound edition with a dust jacket adapted from the original *Studio International* cover, likely coinciding with the exhibition's showing at the Corcoran Gallery. The Praeger edition included an index and contained numerous revisions and changes from the 1968 text. A reprint was issued by Studio International Foundation in 2018 to mark the exhibition's 50th anniversary.

The catalogue is organised into sections dedicated to the connections between the computer and music, dance, poetry, painting, film, architecture, and graphics. It includes a glossary, a bibliography, and contributions from cybernetics originator Norbert Wiener, musicians Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage, and a range of individuals involved in the cybernetic movement, alongside photographic and written documentation of the exhibited creations.

### Selected Essays

In her introduction, Reichardt identified what she considered the most important revelation of the exhibition: that the computer had brought entirely new people into creative activity. Engineers for whom the graphic plotter had been nothing more than a problem-solving tool had become so interested in the possibilities of its visual output that they began making drawings with no practical application, motivated only by the desire to explore and the pleasure of seeing a drawing materialise. People who would never have put pencil to paper had started making images - both still and animated - that approximated and often looked identical to what is conventionally called art.

Mark Dowson's notes on cybernetics sketched a concise history of the field, from the abacus through Pascal's calculator (1642), Leibniz's calculating machine (1673), Jacquard's punch-card-controlled loom (1801), and Babbage's unfinished Analytical Engine (c.1840) to Bush's Differential Analyser (1927) and the construction of ENIAC in 1944. Cybernetics was officially born, Dowson wrote, with the publication of Wiener's *Cybernetics* in 1948 and consolidated by Shannon's *A Mathematical Theory of Communication* the following year.

Reichardt's essay on computer art surveyed the state of the field with characteristic caution. She quoted Dennis Gabor's half-hopeful, half-fearful speculation from 1960 about whether machines would one day replace the creative artist, and noted that while the computer could perform functions that in a broad sense seemed intelligent - manipulating symbols, processing information, obeying complex rules, even learning by experience - it remained incapable of making abstractions and was devoid of imagination, intuition, and emotion. She traced the development of computer graphics from Boeing's coining of the term in 1960, through MIT's Sketchpad experiments, to General Motors' use of cathode ray tube design systems. The Korean artist Nam June Paik, she noted, had gone so far as to claim that in the same way collage had replaced oil paint, the cathode ray tube would replace canvas - though at the time of writing she knew of only three artists who had actually produced computer graphics, the rest having been made by scientists. The computer, she concluded, was only a tool that still seemed far removed from the concerns of art, but even seen through the prejudices of tradition and time, one could not deny that it demonstrated a radical extension in art media and techniques.

A vinyl LP was released by the ICA to accompany the exhibition. The record reflected the prominence of music in the show and was conceived, as the liner notes explained, as "essentially a reportage of current trends and developments in programmed and stochastic music." During the preparation of the exhibition, two things had become apparent: that showing the state of computer music required including material not strictly composed with or played by computer, and that in such an exploratory field, attempts at historical perspective or firm evaluation were premature.

{% capture cs_liner %}
The first landmark in computer composition is Lejaren A. Hiller's *Illiac Suite*, 1957. Many experiments have been carried out before, but these were either exploratory without yielding a tangible music, or were mostly concerned with the technical possibilities of imitating familiar sounds.

Ideas which are relevant to composition with computers were frequently employed in the experimental musical composition of the past thirty years. The work of Joseph Schillinger, for instance, through its systematic analysis and programming, antedates the methods employed by computer composers today. The notion of randomness exemplified in the work of John Cage is also of crucial importance. Randomness (decision avoiding, or more concisely, leaving a decision to chance within an exactly specified range of possibilities) is one of the most important tools of the computer composer.

Computer music falls into two categories: computer composition and computer sound. Specific works may employ one or both of these. *Illiac Suite* is computer composed but performed by a string quartet. Pieces by James Tenney, Gerald Strang and Peter Zinovieff utilise the computer both as a tool to compose with and a sound-making instrument. The experimental pieces produced at Bell Telephone Laboratories make use of existing tunes like *A bicycle built for two* but played and sung by a computer.

As a souvenir of the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition this record is a selection of work in progress. The cover shows a section of a score for *Four Sacred April Rounds* 1968 by Peter Zinovieff.

The ten tracks span over a decade of work, from Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson's *Illiac Suite* (1957) - the first widely recognised computer composition, performed by a string quartet from computer-generated instructions - through John Cage's *Cartridge Music* (1960) and Iannis Xenakis's *Stratégie* (1962) to pieces composed in 1968 specifically for or around the time of the exhibition. Peter Zinovieff's *January Tensions*, at ten and a half minutes the longest track on the record, used the computer both for composition and sound generation. Herbert Brün's *Infraudibles* (1967) explored electronically generated sounds at the threshold of audibility.

The LP was reissued as a limited-edition vinyl by The Vinyl Factory in 2014 to coincide with the ICA's retrospective documentation exhibition.
