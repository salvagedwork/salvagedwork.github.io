**{{ page.title }}** {{ page.description }} The show subsequently travelled to the International Cultural Centre (ICC) in Antwerp, the Württembergischer Kunstverein in Stuttgart, the Institut für moderne Kunst in Nürnberg, and venues in Liverpool and Oxford. The accompanying catalogue, designed by Wim Crouwel and Jolijn van de Wouw of Total Design, remains one of the most thorough documents of the international concrete poetry movement, with texts in Dutch, English, and German and a vinyl LP of sound poetry recordings supervised by Bob Cobbing.

## Background

By 1970, the concrete poetry movement had been developing for roughly two decades, tracing a lineage from Stéphane Mallarmé's typographic experiments through the Futurists, Dadaists, and the proto-concrete work of Carlo Belloli in the 1940s to Eugen Gomringer's *Konstellationen* and the Brazilian Noigandres group's manifesto work of the mid-1950s. The movement had spread across continents, generating an extensive body of work and a complex, sometimes contradictory vocabulary of terms - concrete, visual, phonetic, spatial, material - whose boundaries were the subject of ongoing dispute.

At the same time, a growing sense of exhaustion had set in. In the spring of 1970, Nicholas Zurbrugg's magazine *Stereo Headphones* collected statements from prominent practitioners on the state and future of concrete poetry. Opinions ranged widely, from attacks on poets still working along established lines who produced little more than typographical jokes, to the view that acknowledging the "death" of concrete poetry might clear the way for new forms. It was in this atmosphere - between stocktaking and crisis - that the Stedelijk Museum organised its exhibition, a question mark built into the title itself: *? Klankteksten, Konkrete Poëzie, Visuele Teksten*.

The exhibition was organised under the direction of Liesbeth Crommelin, deputy-curator of the Stedelijk Museum's department of Applied Art, with guidance from an international panel of advisors and curators: Hansjörg Mayer and Reinhard Döhl from Germany, Bob Cobbing from England, and Paul De Vree from Belgium. Additional material was gathered by advisors in numerous countries, among them Pierre Garnier in France, Haroldo de Campos in South America, Seiichi Niikuni in Japan, Bohumila Grögerová and Josef Hiršal in Czechoslovakia, Emmett Williams in the United States, Ugo Carrega and Sarenco in Italy, and Michael Rhodes in Canada.

The result was an ambitious survey featuring work by over one hundred poets from across Europe, North and South America, and Asia, including nine poets from Japan. The exhibition was organised into several sections. It opened with a didactic display of forms and working methods in visual poetry, derived in shortened form from the *Text Buchstabe Bild* exhibition organised that summer in Zürich by Felix Baumann and Reinhard Döhl. The main body of the show presented constellations and arrangements, predominantly typographic, grouped by region or affiliation, beginning with the somewhat isolated figure of Carlo Belloli - a Marinetti disciple who formed a bridge between Futurist ideas and concrete thinking around 1950 - and proceeding through the major groups and individuals who had worked independently in various places since the mid-1950s.

{% include quote.html text="The exhibition came at a time when concrete poetry was in a crisis position internationally. This crisis situation was reflected in the question mark that appears in the title of the exhibition. After all, concrete poetry was declared dead in the English magazine Stereo-headphones.

The exhibition was divided into different sections: a didactic one in which some forms and methods in visual poetry were presented; and the representation of the diversity of constellations and arrangements (mainly typographical) divided into different groupings or geographic regions. As a result, the exhibition was in danger of becoming historic. De Vree was the great advocate for reversing this with the establishment of a third section entitled Open End. This more forward-looking section accommodated poetic work by artists who also used other visual means than purely typographical, often incorporating clear expressions of political-social or conceptual thoughts. Most of these poets will later group themselves into *Lotta Poetica*, the international artists' magazine founded by Sarenco and Paul De Vree in 1971." attribution="- <a href=\"http://ensembles.mhka.be/events/klankteksten-konkrete-poezie-visuele-teksten\" target=\"_blank\">M HKA Ensembles, ?

An exception was made for Japan, whose fundamentally different character system made chronological placement difficult, and for Czechoslovakia, whose political isolation had produced work of such individuality that it resisted periodisation. The final section - the *Open End* advocated by De Vree - featured artists searching for means beyond pure typography to make poetry concrete. This included poets who had shifted their working methods over time, those who had from the outset used other formative means, and those whose work incorporated political, social, or philosophical ideas, sharing properties with other forms of visual art. Many of the poets gathered in this forward-looking section would soon come together in *Lotta Poetica*, the international artists' magazine founded by Sarenco and Paul De Vree in 1971.

Among the artists represented in the exhibition were Augusto de Campos, Décio Pignatari, Claus Bremer, Diter Rot, Daniel Spoerri, André Thomkins, Max Bense, Ferdinand Kriwet, Henri Chopin, Heinz Gappmayr, Öyvind Fahlström, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mathias Goeritz, Eugen Gomringer, Hansjörg Mayer, Timm Ulrichs, Emmett Williams, Kitasono Katue, and many others.

## Exhibition Catalogue

The catalogue runs to 230 pages, printed on thin paper stock in a trilingual edition (Dutch, English, and German) with a foreword by Stedelijk Museum director Edy de Wilde. It was designed by Wim Crouwel and Jolijn van de Wouw of Total Design - the same studio responsible for virtually all of the Stedelijk's graphic identity during Crouwel's tenure as the museum's sole designer from 1963 to 1985. Printed by the Stadsdrukkerij van Amsterdam, the catalogue was issued in white wrappers inside a dust jacket printed in black and blue - Stedelijk Museum exhibition catalogue number 492.

Besides reproducing many of the concrete poems in full-page format, the catalogue contains poet biographies, a bibliography of concrete poetry publications, and listings of related exhibitions and recordings. Its core, however, is a set of three essays by the exhibition's curators, each addressing a distinct aspect of the movement: Paul De Vree on visual poetry, Reinhard Döhl on the literary and linguistic roots of concrete poetry, and Bob Cobbing on concrete sound poetry.

In her introduction, Crommelin acknowledged the paradox at the heart of the project: a movement that had originated some twenty years earlier appeared to have become a closed historical chapter, yet its influence might still evolve along entirely different lines. She deliberately refrained from offering a single definition of concrete poetry, leaving that task to the three essayists.

Paul De Vree's essay on visual poetry traced the movement's visual dimension from Mallarmé through Futurism, Dadaism, De Stijl, and Carlo Belloli's proto-concrete work to the Gomringer constellations and the Noigandres group's formulations of the mid-1950s. He mapped the field's diversity - from the typewriter-based *Materialgruppe* of Darmstadt (Emmett Williams, Diter Rot, Claus Bremer, André Thomkins) through Pierre and Ilse Garnier's spatialism and Hansjörg Mayer's *Typoems* to Pop Art's influence on contemporary poetrygraphy and the three-dimensional object poems of Alain Arias Misson. De Vree was attentive to the terminological tangles that had grown up around the movement, carefully distinguishing between semantics, semiotics, and the *scrittura simbiotica* of Ugo Carrega, and he warned against the danger of "acrobatic typography" threatening to burst through the boundaries of graphic art - a concern shared by Gomringer himself.

Reinhard Döhl situated concrete poetry within a longer literary process, arguing that it could only be understood from its historical roots. He traced the confrontation with symbolic modes of expression back through Arp's account of Kandinsky and the Dadaists, through Apollinaire's *Calligrammes*, Italian Futurism's *parole in libertà*, and the reductive experiments of Gertrude Stein and Kurt Schwitters. For Döhl, the critical development was the progressive reduction of content and liquidation of traditional form - a process in which, as Helmut Heissenbüttel had argued, the question of form versus content became irrelevant. Schwitters appeared throughout as a key but underappreciated figure, one who had already blurred the boundaries between poetry and visual art with his *Elementar-Gedichte* and free typography. Döhl ended on an open question: whether concrete literature represented merely a phase in a larger process, or, as some theorists suggested, an ultimate stage in poetry's development.

Bob Cobbing's essay on concrete sound poetry covered the phonetic and electronic strands of the movement from 1950 to 1970. He began with François Dufrêne and Gil J Wolman's vocal experiments in Paris around 1950 - cri-rhythmes and mégapneumes that went beyond words and the alphabet entirely - and traced the subsequent development of tape-based composition in the work of Henri Chopin, Paul De Vree, Brion Gysin, and Bernard Heidsieck, each working with distinct methods and philosophies. A significant portion of the essay documented the Swedish text-sound composition scene, where the collaboration between the Fylkingen group and Sveriges Radio had since 1967 given poets access to electronic music studios. Cobbing concluded that two complementary lines of development defined the field: one technological, seeking to humanise the machine and marry human warmth to electronically generated sound; the other primitive, returning to incantation, ritual, and the full physical powers of the voice.

The catalogue was accompanied by an LP of concrete poetry recordings, supervised by Bob Cobbing. The record - issued in a PVC sleeve with a folded 12" insert - featured eleven tracks by nine poets, spanning a range of approaches from Chopin's micro-particle vocal compositions to Jandl's phonetic poems for the unaided voice. The recordings dated from as early as 1957 (Ernst Jandl's *Ode auf N*) to pieces composed specifically for the exhibition in 1970. Henri Chopin's *Espaces et gestes*, originally composed in 1959, is representative of his method of exploring the "micro-particles" of the human voice through amplification, superimposition, and speed manipulation. François Dufrêne's *Crirythme pour Bob Cobbing*, composed in 1970, demonstrates the virtuosic vocal outpourings that Cobbing described in his essay as "extended cries, shrieks, ululations, purrs, yarrs, yaups and duckings, the apparently uncontrollable controlled into a spontaneously shaped performance." Paul De Vree contributed two pieces, *Rivièra* and *Het leven is een baccarat*, both from 1967, exemplifying his approach of collaborating with reciters and sound engineers to forge audio-visual poems using loops, repetitions, and echo effects.
