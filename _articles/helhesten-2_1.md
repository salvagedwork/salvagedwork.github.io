## Background

After producing six issues in 1941, *Helhesten* fell silent for nearly a year before this issue appeared in October 1942. The eleven-month gap reflected the journal's growing financial difficulties—the colour printing that had distinguished the publication proved unsustainable under wartime conditions. This would be the only issue published in 1942.

Despite these challenges, the journal continued to serve as a vital forum for Denmark's avant-garde during the occupation. As Guy Atkins notes in *Jorn in Scandinavia*:

{% capture atkins_quote %}
It is now generally recognized that the artists of the war years were by far the most talented generation of painters and sculptors that Denmark has ever produced. The war situation drew these men closer together. They could no longer travel abroad and so they had to rely entirely upon each other for mental stimulus and companionship.

## Cover Design

Niels Lergaard (1893–1982) designed the cover for this issue. Lergaard was a Danish painter associated with the Bornholm school and known for his landscape paintings of the Danish island. He had previously contributed the important essay "The Myth" (*Myten*) to *Helhesten*'s third issue, in which he distinguished between "myth-believing" and "myth-creating" approaches to life and art.

Lergaard's inclusion as a cover artist demonstrated the journal's continued embrace of artists across the Danish modernist spectrum—he was an established figure from an older generation whose work connected to both expressionism and the Scandinavian landscape painting tradition.

## Exhibition Context

In 1942, the Helhesten artists were also active in the Corner and Høst exhibition groups. Jorn exhibited with "Corner og Høst" in 1942, and several Helhesten artists would become core members of the Høst group, which became increasingly important as a venue for Danish avant-garde art.

## Year Two Begins

This issue inaugurated the second year (*2. Aargang*) of the journal. The issue advertised the bound hardcover edition of Year 1, featuring a cover design by Carl-Henning Pedersen, available from the publisher Axelholm for 3 Danish kroner.

## The Helhesten Series

*Helhesten* was published over nine issues from April 1941 to November 1944. The journal was illustrated with over fifty original, mostly colour graphic works, and printed in editions of 800. It was affordable to the general public; a full set of all issues cost twelve kroner, or the equivalent of $2.30 in 1944.
