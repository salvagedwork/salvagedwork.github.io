## Background

This double issue appeared in March 1943, just weeks after the Helhesten artists held a fund-raising exhibition at the Pustervig Kunstnerhandel (Pustervig Art Gallery) on Kompagnistræde in Copenhagen from February 13–25, 1943. The exhibition was organized to help address the journal's growing debt, which had been accumulating since the expensive colour printing of the first year's issues.

As Guy Atkins notes in *Jorn in Scandinavia*:

In 1943 they held a fund-raising exhibition in aid of *helhesten* at the Pustervig Gallery in Copenhagen.

{% include quote.html text=atkins_quote attribution="- Guy Atkins, <em>Jorn in Scandinavia 1930-1953</em>" %}

The gallery was run by student Thorkild Hansen (1927–1989), who later became an important Danish writer. Although no documentation of the exhibition survives, it was likely assembled quickly as a way to raise money for the debt-ridden journal.

## Cover Design

Robert Storm Petersen (1882–1949) designed the cover for this double issue. Known universally in Denmark as "Storm P," he was one of the country's most beloved caricaturists, illustrators, and humorists. His inclusion represented *Helhesten*'s embrace of popular culture and its commitment to bridging high and low art forms.

Storm Petersen's participation in the journal was part of the Helhesten artists' broader interest in satirical imagery, popular art forms, and the "intimate banalities" that Jorn had theorized in his landmark 1941 essay. His whimsical, accessible style aligned with the journal's belief in art's inherent value for everyday life.

## Key Contents

### "Feelings or Instincts" (*Følelser eller drifter*)

Sigurd Næsgaard contributed an essay exploring the relationship between emotions and instincts in artistic creation, continuing the journal's theoretical exploration of spontaneity and the unconscious as sources of creative expression.

## Wartime Context

By 1943, the German occupation had entered a more difficult phase. Danish resistance was growing, and tensions between occupiers and occupied had increased. The journal continued to serve as a space for cultural resistance through its celebration of creative freedom and humanistic values.

## The Helhesten Series

*Helhesten* was published over nine issues from April 1941 to November 1944. The journal was illustrated with over fifty original, mostly colour graphic works, and printed in editions of 800. It was affordable to the general public; a full set of all issues cost twelve kroner, or the equivalent of $2.30 in 1944.
