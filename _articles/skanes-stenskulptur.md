**{{ page.title }}** {{page.description}} It was published in 1965 by the Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism.

## Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism

The Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism *(Skandinavisk Institut for Sammenlignende Vandalisme)* was an organization created by Asger Jorn, Gérard Franceschi, and several scholars, based in Silkeborg and with satellite offices in Paris and Brussels. The Institute was formed to document the artistic tradition of the Scandinavian region in the Northern migration period through photography, but also to show how this tradition migrated through Europe over time. Jorn employed the term *Vandalism* both to reference the popular culture of the period (the Vandals were one of the historic Germanic tribes that sacked Rome in 455 A.D.) and to position himself as a rebel, or *vandal*, who would tell the world about this alternative history to historical art.

For this reason the Institute expresses its gratitude to all those who through their collaboration made this publication possible.\"</em>"

Karen Kurczynski explains:

{% include quote.html text="In 1961, Jorn founded the Scandinavian Institute for Comparative Vandalism (SICV) with photographer Gerard Franceschi and archaeologist Peter Vilhelm Glob. The Institute documented by photograph the persistent forms of folk and Viking Age through Medieval art throughout northern Europe, not only Scandinavia, but also the areas reached by the so-called \"vandal\" cultures, including France, Britain, and Ireland. The institute planned to compile its photographs into a series of publications entitled *10,000 Years of Nordic Folk Art,* which would demonstrate the persistence of folk forms and their influence on fine art throughout European history. Though the photographic documentation process was eventually completed by 1965, the institute was only able to complete a few of the projected publications before Jorn's death, due to lack of funding." attribution="- Karen Kurczynski, <a href=\"https://situationistlibrary.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/kurcynski-expression-vandalism-jorn.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Expression as vandalism: Asger Jorn's \"Modifications\"</a>" %}

The book examines 12th century stone sculptures and reliefs that are found on and in churches throughout the Skåne region. Cinthio provides detailed analyses of sculptures, their provenance, what they depict, and how they are similar to other works found in other regions. Today, the Skåne region is part of Sweden, but was part of the Kingdom of Denmark until 1658.
