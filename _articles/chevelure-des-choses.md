**{{ page.title }}** {{page.description}} The book is a catalogue from the pair's exhibition at Galerie Rive Gauche in Paris in 1961 and is a reproduction of small word drawings made by Jorn and Dotremont from 1948 to 1953, and also specifically from when the pair shared a room at the tuberculosis sanatorium in Silkeborg from November 1951 to February 1952. The catalogue contains a preface by Pierre Alechinsky and an original poem, *L'orthocatalographe* by Dotremont. Presented in a green stiff card slipcase, it was printed in Paris in 1961 by GIL.

Jorn and Dotremont's collaboration on *La chevelure* relates to the pair's association with the Cobra, an experimental art movement active from 1948-1951 that focused on living creation and was a reaction to a perceived sterile and authoritarian atmosphere around modern art. Dotremont and Jorn were co-founders alongside Constant, Corneille, and Joseph Noiret. Their working method was based on spontaneity and experiment, and they drew their inspiration in particular from children's drawings, from primitive art forms and from the work of Paul Klee and Joan Miró.<span class="footnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBRA_(art_movement)" target="_blank">COBRA (art movement).

Prior to the publication and exhibition of *La chevelure*, the pair collaborated on a word-painting in 1948 titled *Ici la chevelure des choses coiffée avec un doigt d'eau* (Here the hair of things capped with a finger of water).
