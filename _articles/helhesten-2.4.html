	<p><em>Helhesten</em> was published over nine issues from April 1941 to November 1944 and featured the abstract expressionist art of the Danish avantgarde group of the same name. The issues also included essays on art theory, non-Western artefacts, literature, poetry, film, architecture, and photography, as well as exhibition reviews and profiles of contemporary Danish artists. <em>{{ page.title }}</em> was named for the three-legged horse associated with Scandinavian mythology that symbolised death and illness.
