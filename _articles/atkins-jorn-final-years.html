	<p>The two most important creative phases described in the present volume both occurred near the end of Jorn’s life. The year 1970 saw a renewal of his serious and almost exclusive dedication to painting - after the distractions of the previous years. The result of this newly found concentration was a sequence of works of the highest order, comparable in quality with those of the mid- to late 1950s.</p>

	<p>In 1972 Jorn turned, for the first time, to sculpture in bronze and marble. His major achievement as a sculptor during this short but important period is described by Ursula Lehmann-Brockhaus in Chapter 4.</p>
	
	<p>By including chapters, contributed by Frank Whitford, on acrylics and collages, a large part of Jorn’s œuvre (in its astonishing variety) has now been sketched out - bearing in mind the chapters on ceramics, graphics and tapestries in the preceding volume.</p>
