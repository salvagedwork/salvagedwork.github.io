**{{ page.title }}** {{ page.description }} Recorded at the Electrola Studios in Cologne, the set is accompanied by two sixteen-page booklets: one containing Heinz-Klaus Metzger's extended essay "Essay on Prerevolutionary Music" in German and English, and the other a bilingual transcription of the recorded conversations occupying the fourth LP. Those conversations - two long discussions edited down from multi-hour sessions held in New York and Cologne - feature Cage, Wolff, and Hans G Helms on the penultimate side, and Morton Feldman, Earle Brown, and Metzger in discussion on the final one. The set remains among the most substantial documents of the New York School's music to have been recorded in Europe, and has commanded collector prices well above its original retail value since shortly after its release.

## Background

The Ensemble Musica Negativa was founded in 1968 or 1969 - sources differ by a year - by Rainer Riehn and Heinz-Klaus Metzger, following the two men's meeting at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in the summer of 1965.<span class="footnote">Wikipedia gives 1968 as the founding year of Ensemble Musica Negativa; several other sources, including the edition-telemark.de biography and Midheaven, give 1969. The discrepancy may reflect an informal founding versus a formal public debut.</span> The ensemble's formation was not incidental to the intellectual relationship between its two animating figures. Metzger (6 February 1932 – 25 October 2009), born in Konstanz, had studied piano under Carl Seemann in Freiburg and composition under Max Deutsch in Paris before encountering Adorno, Varèse, Stockhausen, and Nono at Darmstadt.<span class="footnote">"Heinz-Klaus Metzger," <em>Wikipedia</em>, accessed February 2026, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz-Klaus_Metzger.</span> By the early 1960s he had emerged as one of the first significant European commentators on Cage, a role that crystallised in the Kölner Manifest of 1960 and in his editorial work for the Palermo journal *Collage*. He had also been an early champion of Stockhausen before becoming one of his most pointed critics - a trajectory that shaped the ensemble's specific aesthetic commitments: a commitment to music that was, in Metzger's phrase, genuinely "liberated" rather than merely formally adventurous.

Riehn (12 November 1941 – 9 June 2015), born in Danzig, had studied music theory in Mainz, Zürich, and Berlin, and composition with Gottfried Michael Koenig at the Instituut voor Sonologie in Utrecht - the same institution where he would later attempt, unsuccessfully, to realise a Fontana Mix recording for the present box set.<span class="footnote">Rainer Riehn, letter quoted in liner notes, <em>Music Before Revolution</em> (Odeon C 165-28964/7, 1972). On the Utrecht institute: Rainer Riehn biography, edition-telemark.de, https://www.edition-telemark.de/314.09.html.</span> As conductor and organiser of Musica Negativa, Riehn functioned as the practical enabler of programmes whose intellectual framework Metzger largely supplied.

By 1972, the ensemble had already recorded Cage's *Atlas Eclipticalis*, *Winter Music*, and *Cartridge Music* alongside Dieter Schnebel's *Glossolalie* for Avantgarde, and Riehn had released his own electronic composition *Chants de Maldoror* on Deutsche Grammophon. *Music Before Revolution* represented a more ambitious undertaking: a comprehensive survey of what Metzger, in his liner notes, called the "crucial handful of composers" for whom David Tudor had acted as "unfailing interpreter, playing for unspeakably stingy fees in every possible locality" during the lean years before these composers became internationally known.

The set was produced by Lieselotte Montes-Baquer and engineered by Johann Nikolaus Matthes and Kurt Lorbach. Matthes, who also performed on the recordings - playing the frequency discs in *Imaginary Landscape No. 1* and the phonograph in *Credo in Us* - was a central technical figure in the sessions.

## Metzger's Essay

The liner note booklet's centrepiece is Metzger's "Essay on Prerevolutionary Music," composed in Venice between February and June 1972. Its title derives from a remark by Feldman, printed as one of two epigraphs: "You can't be revolutionary before the revolution." The other epigraph is Cage's: "I don't think we should expect one thing to bring about a revolution. We must use everything... and do everything we can. For some people, words will be effective, for some people, even violence will be effective, for some people, music will be effective. We must use everything."

The essay is a substantial piece of critical writing that refuses easy genre classification: part political philosophy, part close technical analysis, part polemical broadside against the music sociology of both the bourgeois centre and the contemporary left. Metzger's central argument draws a distinction between art's inherent political character - which he regards as objectively present regardless of compositional intention - and the instrumentalisation of that character by parties seeking to deploy music as propaganda. The distinction matters because it allows him to defend the apparent political quietism of Cage and Feldman without abandoning a radical politics: "No artistic procedure, however much committed to the principle of l'art pour l'art, can be divorced from the political implications that ultimately characterise all human activity."

The essay situates the five composers within a tradition of musical anarchism, tracing their debts to Schönberg (who taught Cage during his American exile, and who famously opened his *Harmonielehre* with the sentence "I have learnt this book from my pupils"), and characterising their relationship to one another not as a school but as a non-school - defined above all by their shared relationship to Tudor as interpreter. Metzger is careful to distinguish the composers' individual positions: Cage's "remorselessly cherished rejection of any exertion of power" tends dialectically, he notes, toward the obligatory, while Feldman's scores, in their precise deployment of the traditional score format to achieve actual asynchrony, enact "a paradigm of the dialectical identification of liberté and égalité." The essay draws extensively on Adorno - whose friendship with Metzger dated from the 1950 Darmstadt courses - as well as on Walter Benjamin, Marx, and, more unexpectedly, the Talmud.

Metzger's reading of the *Concert for Piano and Orchestra* as "the musical model for what is, in the last resort, a politically intended anarchy" was influential in shaping European critical reception of Cage's work and has been cited in subsequent scholarship as a significant early account of Cage's political aesthetics.<span class="footnote">See, for example, the discussion of Metzger's account in Martin Iddon and Philip Thomas, <em>John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020), referenced in "The Musical Text: Theorizing Openness after Structuralism," <em>Twentieth-Century Music</em> (Cambridge Core), https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twentieth-century-music/article/musical-text-theorizing-openness-after-structuralism.</span>

## The Conversations

Sides seven and eight of the four-LP set are devoted entirely to recorded speech. The conversations were conducted by Hans G Helms and Heinz-Klaus Metzger with the composers during sessions in New York and Cologne; the tapes were then edited down to fit the available running time - a process the editorial note concedes involved sacrificing "interesting parts" and leaving "some abrupt transitions to new topics."

Side seven pairs Cage and Wolff in separate conversations with Helms, touching on Cage's attendance at Suzuki's Zen lectures at Columbia, his engagement with Maoist China (enthusiastic and frankly admitted to be based on incomplete information), his doubts about the political efficacy of music ("just play any music you like for two people and then talk to them afterwards and see what went on in their heads"), and his long-running ambivalence about whether his current thinking represented progress or confusion compared to the essays collected in *Silence*. Wolff's section addresses the bonds and divergences within the loose grouping of Cage, Feldman, Brown, and himself - the "guerrilla band," as he calls it, held together initially by shared marginality and by the logistical energies of Cage and Tudor, before each composer went his separate way.

Side eight is occupied by a three-way discussion among Feldman, Brown, and Metzger, more contentious in character. Metzger opens by proposing that Feldman's music - by virtue of its extreme quietness - constitutes an objective negation of the existing world, a reading Feldman resists while conceding something to. The discussion moves through the question of art's social responsibility, an argument about whether pop and rock music constitute a "fascism of loudness" (Metzger and Feldman broadly in favour of this framing, Brown sceptical), and ultimately to Feldman's remarkable disclosure - described as something he does not like to address publicly - that he has entertained George Steiner's view that after the Holocaust there perhaps ought to be no more art. "Those values proved to me nothing," Feldman says of the German musical tradition. "They have no longer any moral basis."

## Music on the Record

### Audio

<iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/music-before-revolution&playlist=1&list_height=150" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### John Cage

Four works by Cage occupy the first two LPs. *Imaginary Landscape No. 1* (1939), conceived before the tape era and scored for frequency recordings played on turntables, a large Chinese cymbal, and prepared piano strings, is identified by Metzger as "the first fulfilment of Varèse's prophecies in an actual composition." Since the frequency test-discs available to Cage in Seattle in 1939 were unobtainable by 1972, the parts were simulated on a synthesiser with Cage's permission.

*Credo in Us* (1942) was originally composed as accompaniment to a dance performance by Merce Cunningham and Jean Erdman. The score, calling for two muted gongs, tin cans, electric buzzer, tom-toms, piano, radio, and phonograph playing "some classics" - with Dvořák, Beethoven, Sibelius, or Shostakovich proposed - represents what Metzger calls an act of "Oedipal rebellion" against the canon, complicated by the fact that the score's final fermata hands the last word back to the "previously murdered 'classic.'" In the present recording, the phonograph part was shaped not by an ensemble member but by the artistic supervisor at Electrola.

The *Concerto for Piano and Orchestra* (1957–58), performed simultaneously with *Solo for Voice I* (1958) and *Solo for Voice II* (1960), occupies the entire second LP side. The *Concerto* consists of 63 pages of piano notation using 84 different notational systems, plus independent orchestral parts that may be combined, omitted, or performed solo in any combination; the conductor functions not as a director of ensemble but as an erratically functioning clock, indicating passing time with circular arm movements. Pianist Hermann Danuser separated the individual structures of his part with significant silences, explaining in correspondence quoted by Metzger that "the prototypal character I have striven for in each individual structure can't be realised any other way."

*Rozart Mix* (1965) exists in the form of a correspondence between Cage and Alvin Lucier regarding a proposed concert at Brandeis University's Rose Art Museum. Cage, lacking the time or studio space for new composition, proposed that students hold "splicing parties," cutting and joining taped material into loops of various lengths for simultaneous playback on multiple machines. The present recording emerged from a session in which members of both Musica Negativa and Electrola personnel participated spontaneously - no performer list was kept, and none could afterwards be reconstructed.

### Earle Brown

The entirety of Brown's loose-leaf album *Folio* (1952/53), together with its appendix *Four Systems* (1954), occupies LP three and part of LP four. The seven sheets of *Folio* range from *October 1952*, which retains conventional rhythmic symbols while eliminating metric context, to *November 1952* ("Synergy"), scored on a fifty-line staff without clefs and offering performers radical spatial and temporal latitude, to *December 1952*, where white space and black rectangles of varying dimensions replace conventional notation entirely and the performer may begin at any edge of the page and read in any direction.

The intermediate pieces *MM-87* and *MM-135, March 1953* are described by Brown as having been "composed very rapidly and spontaneously and are in that sense performance rather than compositions" - an inversion of the usual relationship between notation and act. *Music for "Trio for Five Dancers," June 1953* was derived from marks on a stage floor transferred proportionally to manuscript paper. The final piece, *1953*, returns to conventional notation but represents durations by graphic lengths rather than symbolic values, establishing what Brown developed into "time notation."

Metzger's notes describe an interpretive dispute during the sessions: the ensemble had planned to use electro-acoustic manipulation for *November* and *December 1952* in accordance with the scores' explicit permission for "any sound-producing media," but Brown objected. Brown also pressed the musicians toward mutual reaction and jazz-like collective responsiveness, despite this not being indicated in the performance instructions; Riehn, opposed in principle to directing performers "like a hypnotist," conducted at least minimally in both pieces as a compromise.

*Four Systems* (1954), inscribed "for David Tudor on a birthday, Jan. 20, 1954," is characterised by Metzger as a set of four variations on *December 1952*. Brown conducted these pieces according to the approach he would later systematise in the *Available Forms* series.

### Christian Wolff

*In Between Pieces for Three Players* (1963) is scored in Wolff's own notational system for three performers - in this recording, violoncello, double bass, and regal. The score leaves the specific instruments entirely open, since, as Metzger observes, "the object of the composition is not connection between sounds, but between people." Written signs refer to relationships with fellow players' actions, making heard events as much a part of the notation as written ones. Metzger acknowledges that the work resists conventional analytical description: its particular character derives from "negation of the principle of being derived from a principle."

*Electric Spring 2* (1966–70), for alternating soprano and tenor recorder, electric guitar, electric bass guitar, and trombone, presents a contrast: it is a precisely notated piece whose score, while appearing spare, prescribes specific acoustic results whose sequence constitutes "a logically constructed musical form." Metzger singles it out as "one of the rare pieces that might lead a scribe to what is for him an unnatural opinion, namely that music is what one can hear."

### Morton Feldman

Three Feldman works span LP five. *The Straits of Magellan* (1961), scored for flute, horn, trumpet, electric guitar, harp, piano, and double bass, employs the "box" notation Feldman developed in the *Intersection* pieces around 1950 - a grid whose square units indicate time-spans, pitch regions (high, middle, low), and numbers of attacks, without specifying individual pitches. Though the score prescribes a constant tempo of MM 88 per box throughout, the varying density of events produces the impression of continual fluctuation.

*For Franz Kline* (1962), written for horn, soprano, piano, chimes, violin, and cello, uses conventional score format and notated pitches, but with a radical difference: there is no temporal coordination between parts beyond the simultaneous opening downbeat. Each performer follows an inner pulse of their own choosing, which they may accelerate or retard at will, with the result that the piece always ends in succession rather than together - producing what Metzger calls "a composition with several successive endings."

*Between Categories* (1969), for two identically constituted instrumental groups (piano, chimes, violin, and cello), involves Feldman himself as pianist. Metzger interprets it as an essay in fraternal rather than anarchistic collectivity - "moments of controlled playing together on the basis of a chamber music-like form of agreement are prevalent in both" groups, with individual extravagance less frequent.

### Toshi Ichiyanagi

The sixth LP contains two works by Ichiyanagi (b. 1933), a Japanese composer who had studied with Cage in New York in the late 1950s and been associated with Fluxus. *Sapporo* (1962), for a conductor and fifteen players using any sound-producing elements they wish, distributes the sixteen sheets of the score among participants who may also exchange sheets with one another; written signs describe both sonic characteristics and the action of listening to or observing fellow performers, making temporary audience-members of the musicians. Metzger characterises its organising ideal as "an egalitarian distribution of the individual production processes and consumption."

*Life Music* (1964) incorporates a tape that plays throughout the performance, functioning simultaneously as music for the audience and - under conditions given in the score - as notation for the musicians. The orchestral score divides into seven sections, distinct in character but interchangeable in order, each given a two-minute time-slot.

## Reception and Legacy

The box set was marketed at a price point that placed it beyond casual purchase, and its initial German-market distribution was limited. It has never been officially reissued as a vinyl set, though a CD-R reproduction circulated under the "Proto Creel Pone" label in 2003 significantly widened its audience among collectors of experimental music. Copies of the original box set have sold at Discogs for between $75 and $260, with the set averaging a rating of 4.74 out of 5 from nineteen ratings and appearing on the want lists of over 260 users as of early 2026.<span class="footnote">Ensemble Musica Negativa, <em>Music Before Revolution</em>, Discogs release page [r872739], https://www.discogs.com/release/872739-Ensemble-Musica-Negativa-Music-Before-Revolution, accessed February 2026.</span>

Metzger and Riehn would go on to found their influential musicological series *Musik-Konzepte* in 1977, which they co-edited until 2003. In 1987, the two also served as chief dramaturgists at the Oper Frankfurt, where they commissioned John Cage's *Europeras 1 & 2* - a collaboration that would not have been imaginable without the groundwork laid by *Music Before Revolution* fifteen years earlier.

The 2008 remastering of several of the Cage works (notably *Credo in Us* and the *Concerto for Piano and Orchestra*) for the American Classics series indicates the sessions' enduring technical as well as historical significance.
