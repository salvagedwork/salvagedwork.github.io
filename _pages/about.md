# An (un)archive manifesto.

This archive challenges the notion of what types of content should be considered worthy of preservation.

**This archive challenges officially-sanctioned systems of classification and uses the curatorâ€™s own narrative as a tool for exploration and discovery.**

*This archive digitizes the analogue, seeking to bring new relevance to works that have languished in out of print, impossibly expensive, or hard to find editions.*

This archive makes no claims to copyright but aims (when appropriate) to avoid sharing works that are currently in print.

***This archive accepts no forms of financial support and hosts no advertising.***

This archive accepts donations of works that others may find relevant for inclusion.

*This archive remains ignorant of the complexities of the contexts that it is directed at.*
