			<h1 id="asger-jorn-and-10000-years-of-nordic-folk-art">ASGER JORN AND 10,000 YEARS OF NORDIC FOLK ART</h1>

<p>Published on the occasion of the exhibition ASGER JORN AND 10,000 YEARS OF NORDIC FOLK ART at the National Museum, 15.11.-9.2.1995-96 and at Silkeborg Art Museum 3.3.-27.5.1996.</p>

<p>The exhibition is supported by the Nordic Culture Fund, the National Museum Council, Cultural Capital 96 and Silkeborg Municipality.</p>

<p>The exhibition and catalog are organized by Troels Andersen and Tove Nyholm.</p>

<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>

<p>Why must these volumes be published? First and foremost because there exists no comprehensive work on the art of the Nordic past, and because this absence has given the outside world the impression that we Northerners are an unartistic people.</p>

<p>But naturally there are several reasons why the books must come out. I believe, among other things, that they have something to offer that no other books have offered. This is an ambitious claim, and when I must justify it, I must immediately say that I have not discovered many new things in the past that researchers have not already described. But I believe I have discovered something new about the things: I believe I can place them in a picture and show that they are links in a rich universal context - and if I succeed in reaching this goal, then the work has succeeded.</p>

<p>I believe an artist has the prerequisites to do this piece of work. I am not a scientist, but within the field of art I am a professional. Through my art I have learned to see and find meaningful connections where others may not see them. If these books offer something new, then it is an artist’s view of the past.</p>

<p>I have found the past on long journeys. Over a number of years I have traveled from place to place together with the photographer Gérard Franceschi and seen things I did not believe existed. Together we have used our eyes and in a duality of searching for photographic motifs and for artistic meaning found our way to the images. Gradually the number of photographs has grown, and so far we have 20,000 images covering a time period spanning 10,000 years. The images say something that the books will tell: that the Nordic art of the past also explains the Nordic art of the present, that the innermost meaning of this art is the spirit that lies behind all things, permeates them and makes them deeply personal. This emanation of spirit tells us that the expressionist concept is a state that has been natural to move in throughout our long past, and that we in the North have remained in this state on the journey up to the present.</p>

<p>For a long time I believed that I was the only one who had grasped the nerve of this concept, but during my studies I discovered that I was working further on a foundation that had already been indicated by the Dane Julius Lange and by the Swede Johnny Roosval.</p>

<p>But there was simply no one who had utilized this already existing foundation. Perhaps because it is our own. Perhaps because we always measure our own culture in relation to the distance to Paris, Rome and the Acropolis. Through centuries, indeed perhaps millennia, we in the North have suffered from an admiring inferiority complex toward the creations of the Mediterranean countries. Therefore art historians have regarded our things as dilutions of something already existing. But our art is not provincial by nature. It has its distinctive character. One can see how people through centuries have preserved and protected thousands of artistic works throughout the countries from a sense of treasures, which reveals that the things are the poor people’s wonderful treasures. When one observes these anonymous sculptures at the church doors, the baptismal fonts’ heavy reliefs, the standing stones in the open field and the woodwork’s serpent coils, which continue in an eternity ornament - then it strikes one that art has been cultivated as something unique, and that the artists have invested the feeling for the unique in their works. It is not a provincial dilution of the culture from the south that one encounters here, but characteristic expressions of the region’s and province’s distinctive character. They came into being precisely in this place, under these living conditions and among these people and created precisely for them. They are signs to which one attributes cultic, mythical, magical, human and artistic significance, and over the centuries we still sense that they represent the unique itself, albeit in a remarkably quiet way.</p>

<p>When the artworks often seem modest in size, this is not due to lack of craftsmanship ability, but contempt for the oversized, the over-industrialized and the schematic, for artistic advertising without coverage. One does not want to work longer than feeling reaches, so that things do not lose their content and art its meaning. Therefore one rarely experiences the ostentatious pompous, and this intimate modesty contains the human richness that characterizes Nordic art.</p>

<p>When we through centuries have had difficulty finding this richness, it was because the past was viewed by academic eyes, which were blinded by classicism. But contemporary art has opened up 10,000 years of the past. Through contemporary art we experience the past as something warm and present. As conscious property.</p>

<h2 id="old-danish-art">Old Danish Art</h2>

<p><em>In 1949 Asger Jorn began to prepare a manuscript and select images for a book on the art of the earliest times in Denmark, which he would write together with P.V. Glob. Over the course of a few months Jorn completed his part of the manuscript, and Glob arranged for him to collaborate with the National Museum’s photographer Lennart Larsen on a series of new photographs for the book. The result was a series of photographs that dramatically staged the objects of ancient art in a completely new way. The joint project stranded, but Jorn had nevertheless completed a full layout of his text and images up to and including the conclusion of the Bronze Age. Later he broke up the manuscript again, and added new sections. The whole ended as a large fragment, from which the following sections are taken.</em></p>

<h3 id="hunting-art-in-denmark"><strong>Hunting Art in Denmark</strong></h3>

<p>The oldest pictorial representations that exist at all in Danish art have been pricked or incised in deer antlers and bone implements from the Early Stone Age. The peculiar sensitivity that is traced in these lines and dots over the polished bone surfaces seems actually incompatible with our ideas about primitive Stone Age people, but perhaps these ideas are wrong. Why are these implements filled with images, what do they mean, can we interpret these messages from the oldest ancestors who inhabited our land. Our art began there thousands of years ago. What does it tell us?</p>

<p>(…) If one incises on an object images of animals, humans or natural forces, then these images will give the decorated object the depicted figures’ power and properties. The modern purely surface-filling ornament we use today purely aesthetically without deeper meaning is a result of the specialization of written language and a completely unknown phenomenon for natural peoples, whose ornamentation is simultaneously their writing, i.e. linked to their conceptual world as a form of expression, so that every line system gets a specific meaning and intention.</p>

<h3 id="the-amber-figures"><strong>The Amber Figures</strong></h3>

<p>If one finds in the implement decorations no direct connection with common hunting magic, there nevertheless seems to be a contact with these subjects in the small animal sculptures in amber from this period.</p>

<p>Our pearl necklaces alone show how strong an attraction the rich amber deposits have had on our ancestors by the coasts in the earliest times. Later it would become the great export commodity in the Bronze Age, which conditioned our wealth of southern bronze. Easy to work with and beautiful in its golden transparency, this material has been self-evident for jewelry and amulets. However, it is doubtful whether the four small figures depicted here have had this use. In their simple plasticity, apparently representing a goose, a wild boar, a bear and furthermore an indeterminate animal, they give a fleeting image of the hunter’s sphere of interest. A peculiar circumstance is that some of them bear clear burn marks, indeed one of them is almost burned up. This could suggest that rather than having been amulets they may have been sacrificed in a kind of bonfire ceremony in connection with a hunting ritual, and therefore left half-consumed in the fire’s embers. This sounds less unlikely when one considers that amber as fragrant resin has undoubtedly been used as incense offerings throughout antiquity.</p>

<p>Pronounced amulets, on the other hand, are some amber jewelry with drill holes for carrying cords. They also have incised figures on their simple surfaces. Most interesting are the most recent finds, where the ornament always consists of horizontal lines with a series of vertical fringes. Many theories have emerged about the interpretation of these comb-like figures. If it should be representations of grain with connection to the agricultural peoples’ Menhirs in France, the fringes would have to face the other way. Perhaps the largest amber lump could demonstrate such a kinship, but the find of corresponding amber figures washed ashore from the Dogger Banks seems to date their age considerably further back. That it should be thunderstones with representations of falling rain can equally little be proven, and no direct connection with the Bronze Age’s comb ornaments can be demonstrated either. The problem lies here as on so many other of this period’s pictorial representations and awaits a sustainable solution, but however the solution will be, it is in any case clear that life and art in this period prepare a transition, whose results over the course of a few thousand years would change human living conditions on earth in ever faster tempo towards a mastery of all living things on earth. The key to this was the transition to the productive life form based on agriculture, cattle breeding and crafts. This transition changed not only the material and social conditions, but the entire nature of art.</p>

<h2 id="late-stone-age-danish-peasant-art"><strong>Late Stone Age. Danish Peasant Art</strong></h2>

<p>The dolmens and passage graves, the large burial mounds from the Late Stone Age, which we find throughout the country, are perhaps our people’s most magnificent monuments. With inconceivable efforts people have built these giant monuments to human cooperation. It is not some refined miniature art, hardly even a shaping, rather an assembly of stone blocks. One sees that the mentality has changed and art has gained new dimensions. Thing and image merge into a peculiar artistic synthesis. But not only in dolmens and passage graves do we see this. It characterizes all conditions. The pictorial style has also become different. This is particularly starkly evident where people on Norwegian cliffs have carved new rock carvings on top of the old ones from the hunting period. This broad reversal in pictorial style we also find, as mentioned, in the south.</p>

<p>If the new pictorial art from Spain’s and France’s first agricultural period represents a break with the old naturalistic tradition from the hunting period, and we see the same happen at a later time in the North, and art in this period gets an apparently primitive and abstract character, this is not an expression of a simplification, but on the contrary of a far more complicated and richer conception of art. If this transition is to be characterized, it is done most clearly by calling it the transition from a representational art to a symbolic art.</p>

<p>By <em>representational art</em> we must understand an art that sees its purpose in changing a material so that it apparently becomes something other than it is in reality. Just as an actor through disguise, mimicry and speech attempts to transform himself into a completely different person than he himself is according to his nature, so one also seeks in the naturalistic image to conceal as much as possible its material character of clay or paint in order thereby to achieve the highest illusion effect of animals, humans etc. of purely immaterial representational content.</p>

<p>In <em>symbolic art</em>, on the other hand, this dualism between material and representation does not exist. It is an expression of a different and more intricate way of thinking, in that it seeks as much as possible to manifest the thing’s <em>own</em> existence, while simultaneously through analogies connecting and paralleling this with <em>other</em> phenomena to create their synthesis. The dancer with the bull mask should not create the illusion of a bull, but is <em>both</em> himself and the bull, a human-bull, indeed his bull mask could perhaps even be made of grain straws, so he becomes a synthesis of grain, cattle and human and thereby a representative of organic life as a whole. In the same way the image of for example a wheel can primarily be incised as ornament on a vessel to enrich the metal’s material effect. It can even be traced merely as a circle without spokes, since everyone knows that it is a wheel sign. At the same time it is not merely a wheel, but an image of the wandering sun, of the human race’s destiny in generation after generation and of the year’s and time’s course, of movement in general. If representational art seeks through pictorial effects to create pure illusion, then conversely symbolic art seeks directly to manifest itself, to be itself as an individual phenomenon, but simultaneously to be more than that, to reach out to the most distant phenomena and connect itself with these. To find the universal all.</p>

<p>When peasant art automatically is led into a symbolic form, this is because it is precisely the sharpening of the peasant’s sense of analogies that conditions the development of his occupation. He must understand that the grain that comes up in the field will do the same next year and the next again, if he carefully and regularly plows and sows as he should and when he should. He gradually understands that this phenomenon is identical with what happens in the fertilization of animals and humans. All these things connect for him in a causal continuity that gives everything he works with that shimmer of poetry, which is the most characteristic feature of Bronze Age and Late Stone Age art. In contrast to the hunting art’s more epic matter-of-factness, it reflects his deep understanding of things’ inner connection, that which has always been poetry’s inner essence.</p>

<p>Peasant art has become a communal art, has become social, partly because his occupation entails greater social coherence and partly because his feeling of identity with nature abolishes the preconditions for the hunting people’s strict demands for naturalistic shaping. Nature and humans have become one, so it knows what humans know, and since one human easily learns what another human knows, art is simplified more and more into easily readable and practically designed signs which presuppose a social culture, a spiritual community, which today we have difficulty interpreting, because the doctrine has disappeared, but which nevertheless ranges from more realistic reproductions to script-like pictography. It is in this period that written languages are born.</p>

<p>Now humans move in as the artistic core motif, but not as individuals, rather as universal phenomena. At this time humans created God in their own image. No wonder that also in pictorial art the interest shifts from the representation of individual phenomena to connections, regularities and types. Thing realism has given way to a connection realism, a geometric art. This designation is in the very truest sense correct. The expression of nature’s regularities they sought in graphics at this time is in reality the first foundation for modern geometric science, even though the purpose was different.(…)</p>

<h3 id="the-face-urns"><strong>The Face Urns</strong></h3>

<p>Among the pottery in the later part of the Stone Age are a number of so-called face urns, which stand out from the rest with their peculiar decoration with mask-like heads. Possibly it was the jug’s ears that inspired the formation of the powerful eyebrows and the placement of eyes underneath, but gradually there is no doubt that the figures caught on due to their magical content and are included as a symbol in the cultic art circle. They spread from culture to culture. We find face urns closely related to the Danish ones in the Iberian peasant cultures in Spain. Unusually lively are these round bird-shaped eyes incised in rhythmic, almost nervous lines in the soft raw clay. There is something hectic about them, which is lost when we find them again in the Bronze Age, but at the same time some of the life has also been burned out of them.</p>

<p>This face motif on jugs and pitchers has been popular right up to our day in folk ceramics. Did people then perceive the jug as a living being, or is it what was in the jug, the grain, the porridge or the drink, that was considered living, or is it a deity’s eyes that watch over both jug and contents. No one can say today, but judging from normal primitive peasant mentality, one would be inclined to say both, by virtue of his special view of nature.</p>

<p>Without understanding the ambiguity of symbolic art, it will be impossible to grasp the meaning of the eyes on the face urns. Among the Spanish rock carvings and cliff paintings from this period we find a figure that with its dominant eyes seems to be the same as the one we find on the urns. This figure is framed in wickerwork and has toes that also do not extend beyond the frame. In this it resembles the peculiar figures incised on the contemporary French Stone Age sculptures, the so-called Menhirs. People have wondered why, after the hunting period, they had suddenly lost the ability to draw a person so that it resembled one. But in reality one must reckon with the fact that it is not an ordinary person that is sought to be represented here. Comparing the figure with the male and female figures that we here in the North have made until today from the harvest’s last sheaf, the similarity is striking, right down to the woven band around the waist and the straws on the back. If we then conclude that the faces on the Danish urns correspond to the Nordic harvest hags, the traditions to which we can connect become manifold.(…) There are thus good reasons to connect the face urns with foreign folkloristic traditions, all the more so since we in the museum’s face jug from the 14th century (probably of German origin) find a double face or Janus head, which has given its name to the month of January and is characteristic as a year symbol.(…)</p>

<p>If one can perceive the face urns as a seasonal and vegetation symbol, then their connection with burial seemingly provides another possibility for interpretation. In Bronze Age China we find in the same period the face urn as a sacrificial bowl in the form of bronze vases, which were cast and sacrificed in the temple to promote the family’s welfare. The eyes on the bowl were those of the ancestors, to whom the sacrifice was brought so that they would watch over the family and help it. Although such an interpretation must also be natural for the Danish face urns, this does not contradict what we have said before. If the ancestors are to have the power to influence the living’s living conditions, they must naturally be able to change these. The deceased must therefore continue to live in nature, united with it through burial or cremation, and since the primitive farmer as we have mentioned perceives humans as nature’s model and core, it is naturally from a totemistic view of nature to perceive the deceased as having entered the cycle of natural forces in one way or another. When one has therefore sown the grain, one has undoubtedly perceived this as a sacrifice to the ancestors, while the harvest in turn was a gift from the ancestors, indeed as their embodiment. This makes it understandable that the last sheaf harvested in the field must contain its concentrated spirit or its germinating power, and that the harvest hag or man made from this sheaf as representative of the deceased was a guardian spirit that protected people and goods as long as it was in the house, and that it therefore had to be treated with the greatest reverence. Only as a union of nature and family symbol can one understand this phenomenon.</p>

<h3 id="bronze-ages-poetry"><strong>Bronze Age’s Poetry</strong></h3>

<p>A immediately captivating calm and joy of life emanates from Bronze Age art in Denmark, not a stiff and angular equilibrium, there are no hooks on the crosses, but a supple light and lively mobility, where the drama’s hard contours and abrupt line breaks are happily avoided. Everything flows and moves, bends and returns like a young forest in spring dress. It is not really pictures of animals and plants that do it, but the inner structure in the things themselves, which as it were transforms the bronze into an organic world, instruments and tools, as well as figures and ornaments. A comparison with contemporary art from the south shows a quite different hard and often somewhat mechanically insensitive style, as in the bronze bucket with the gold bowls from Italy, where only the bowls’ graceful handles are Danish.</p>

<p>Nowhere does this peculiar mood-saturated grace emerge as clearly as in the small female figures, which are so characteristic of this <em>poetic</em> art. They may perhaps in their symmetrical form remind one somewhat of Negro sculptures, they are not human imitations, but symbols, and yet the mood is quite different. Some of the figures may in their dignity be strict and strong like idols from Crete, but at the same time the best of them possess a soft grace that, as in <em>the figure with the jug</em>, can seem quite virginal. It is perhaps no coincidence that Virgo, the classical celestial virgin, is often depicted with a jug between her hands.</p>

<p>The woman with the jug is not a rarity, but one of art’s oldest and most beloved motifs. Long before people knew anything about pottery, in the Ice Age, we encounter the relief of the woman with her horn of plenty. Food and drink have always been the woman’s privilege to administer, and there is every reason why this motif has held first place in the people’s favor through millennia. But there is no reason to believe that we are here dealing with a submissive servant. It is the food and drink that recreates the human being, and as such in the materialistic religion is embraced with the highest veneration. We have hinted at what a central position the jug has had in nature worship, and there is no reason to believe that this is about anything other than a cultic representation, whether the woman has brought forth her jug for a feast or an offering, as we know it from the previously mentioned May festivals.</p>

<p>If this motif is classical in age and favor, then the same can be said with equal right about the woman who presses her breasts with her hands. This motif so characteristic of Danish Bronze Age is executed in several small bronze statuettes. Here it is absolutely impossible to avoid that it is about small fertility idols and mother figures, which people apparently perceived as beneficial for birth and growth power.</p>

<p>Such figures are also known already in the Ice Age. These so-called Venus figures, such as the one from Willendorf, were however not quite as slender as those represented here.</p>

<p>Both the woman with the jug or cup and the Venus type follow along in both ancient and Christian art. The latter we find in Romanesque granite sculptures, as well as later in wood on Baroque church carvings. The body here usually transitions into a plant-like stem or trunk, so that one gets the impression that <em>the woman is a kind of tree or mother stem.</em> At times a pair of fantastic animals suckle the taut breasts. Looking more closely at the South French menhir, one will discover that the female figure here also holds her hands under the breasts. The figure thus in this connection seems to stand as a symbol for nature and the growth of plants in the same way as the May tree or the Christmas sheaf that is placed in the treetop. We claimed that the jug was the same symbol as the straw woman. The woman with the jug is in that case the two elements, united into one, a mother nature if you will.</p>

<p>This simultaneously explains why the female figure in the group with the snake-horse and horned cattle has large gold-inlaid eyes. Here we have the female counterpart to the previously mentioned wooden block Torbjørn with the metal eyes. This female figure holds only one breast, but we also find parallels to it in Baroque Danish church art, where it is found virtually everywhere.</p>

<p>That <em>the woman with the gold eyes has the same symbolic meaning as the face urns</em> is supported by a drawing, incised in one of the many beautiful razors we own from this time, and whose images have a central place in the Bronze Age pictorial world. When we find answers to so many cultic problems by looking at the razors’ decoration, this is hardly due to a random decorative whim. An analogy between <em>sickle and grain</em> in the field and <em>razor and beard</em> on the chin is of the kind of nature-human analogies that belong to the self-evident. As such, the many sacrificed <em>hair braids</em> and beautifully decorated combs and comb images found in this period must also be perceived. The Samson concept of hair’s power has not been a specifically Jewish phenomenon. The razor of which we have spoken in this connection shows two snake-like animals with four legs and mane facing a figure that can hardly be perceived as anything other than a jug, a symbolic composition we still know today from our pharmacy signs, and which was a popular motif in Greek and Egyptian art. Such a snake-like sea horse we find again in connection with the eye woman, and it is probably meant to suckle her breast, from which she squirts milk with her hand. When we find the motif again on the medieval baptismal font, one of the church’s sacred vessels, a rebirth bowl, this is because it has ancestry all the way back to the Stone Age’s urns. It is probably also not coincidental that we on an urn lid from the Bronze Age find again the pictorial motif found in the bottom of most baptismal fonts, <em>the couple around the tree.</em> It is not so long ago that newborns were led through a tree or a hole in the ground also here in the North. Much speaks for the fact that the five figures that make up the composition around the woman with the gold eyes have been equipment for a sacred vessel that has been lost, possibly because it was made of wood. Whether it was a drinking or baptismal vessel or something entirely different, one can only guess about.</p>

<p>Another small sculpture, a graceful acrobatic dancer who in a daring arc leans completely backward, supple as a willow wand, can in any case hardly be explained in any other way than as part of a vessel or pitcher, where she probably served as a handle. This figure is undoubtedly created after an Etruscan model, but is at the same time typically Danish both in form and style. The elegant little string skirt, which we recognize from several of the other female figures, and of which preserved examples have been found, leaves no doubt about the origin, and there is also far from the Roman craftsmen’s clumsy naturalistic figures, which seem quite out of place in connection with utilitarian objects, to the soft, supple plasticity of this female figure.</p>

<p>It would also be naive to be satisfied with the observation that we are here dealing with a formal imitation of Roman models, just as naive as wanting to deny this relationship. We know all too well these two extreme positions that people like to adopt toward Nordic art. Both bracteates, Ragnarok myth and much else have been treated from these positions. Let us therefore establish that it is altogether incompatible with a natural conception of art merely to imitate a foreign thing because it looks exciting, while on the other hand it would be contrary to the historical facts to want to deny the importance of classical cultures in the North. The question is only how such an influence takes place.</p>

<p>Henrik Ussing says that “for people who largely live in the same culture, linguistic and ethnographic differences do not matter much when it comes to legends and fairy tales, they can easily spread from country to country, from race to race. If two peoples have different <em>main occupations</em>, however, understanding will be much more difficult to achieve”. This applies equally to artistic motifs. The North’s <em>main occupation</em> in the Bronze Age was <em>agriculture</em>, crafts and trade, while for the Mediterranean countries’ leading cultures it was <em>war</em> and plunder. Therefore the North’s art developed in a different cadence than the southern. It is first in the Eddas’ time that we have a parallel to Homer.</p>

<p>If a motif does not have some natural connection to domestic traditions and ideas, then it does not penetrate into its motif world at all. Everywhere we find a new artistic motif, it is therefore always natural to reckon with two factors: foreign models and domestic preconditions, which together determine the assimilation process, and it must of course always be the domestic precondition that is the most essential.</p>

<p>But what then is the precondition for this figure that resembles a dancer? We find on Swedish rock carvings dancing acrobats who bend in exactly the same way in backward jumps. In this country we first find corresponding motifs much later, in a Romanesque picture block and in the depiction of Salome’s dance on a medieval fresco.</p>

<p>Are we here dealing with a continued Danish tradition, and is it in that case a pictorial tradition or a dance tradition. No pictorial tradition can be demonstrated, and since the Middle Ages’ frescoes usually took their motifs from the religious plays that were performed, and these in turn were transformations of ritual pagan seasonal mimes, there is probably every reason to perceive Salome’s dance as an import from the south, with an adaptation to various Nordic dance traditions. This can be determined by examining whether motifs are found elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="rock-carvings-and-processions"><strong>Rock Carvings and Processions</strong></h3>

<p>The Bronze Age rock carvings undoubtedly depicted cult festivals and thereby give us a rich illustration of the Bronze Age’s artistic life. Although it is during a limited period of the Bronze Age that these figures are carved, there is nevertheless no reason to assume that the scenes they depict are also limited to this short period of time. Both before and after, indeed up to our day, we find elements of the cults depicted here.</p>

<p>The most characteristic feature of these scenes is their peculiar decentralized mobility. In contrast to the contemporary Mycenaean, Babylonian, Egyptian and Chinese art, one never gets the impression of any central figure. Here as there, these are images of processions and parades, but here the procession does not halt at some figure that is its goal. These are parades and scenes for their own sake, for their own effect. The composition is, so to speak, unconscious, a layering that has become fuller and richer with each passing year. The processions still known as Shrovetide parades, riding summer into town, St. John’s festivals, carnival, Christmas and New Year celebrations and the like undoubtedly contain many elements that have been preserved from the earliest agricultural period. The large Bronze Age mounds that still exist are not burial mounds but festival sites, which testify to the great popular outdoor plays that were the basic element of the art of that time, the source from which all other art forms drew, and around which it revolved in nature and form.</p>

<h3 id="the-cup-marks"><strong>The Cup Marks</strong></h3>

<p>What is the meaning of the cup marks found in immense quantities from the Bronze Age and Late Stone Age in cliffs and stones. They are sacred symbols that are older than rock carvings in general. There is therefore reason to perceive them as central to the cultic unity, since they are also created in more recent times, indeed used for magical purposes right up to our day.</p>

<p>In Sweden they are often called elf-mills and were often also used as offering bowls. The designation contains a connection to both water and grain, and in fact most cup hollows are found around old fields and springs. Certain loose stone blocks (such as the one from Før) completely covered with large and small stone pits on all sides show that it has not been the intention to make offering bowls like the Indian Linga symbols, although a kinship is certainly present. It has not been so much the drill hole itself as the representation of or the drilling of the hole that has been the object of cultic custom. What ideas set this process in motion. There are several possibilities. Either the drilling can be a knowledge from stone processing, sprung from the stonemason’s art, or it can be a transfer of fire drilling similar to the so-called need-fire, which has certainly also been an annual renewal of fire, a new fire. And finally, as the name mill suggests, it can be an imitation of primitive grain mills. The reason why this process has been transferred to cliffs and stones undoubtedly lies in the fact that the rhythmic mill has been perceived as a fertility-bringing erotic play. In this way, both the axe, fire drilling and grain are linked to erotic symbolism. The bowl in the cliff has in this way symbolized mother earth in the same way as the jug.</p>

<p>We find on several medieval churches corresponding holes drilled around the entrance portals (among others in Lund Cathedral). Here it is not the drilling, but the sandstone powder that emerges, which seems to have had the greatest interest. Combined with the people’s extensive use of crushed stone axes or thunderbolts as medicine, this provides possibilities for further interpretations in the same way as the extensive use of cup marks for offerings. The characteristic of all these explanations is that one does not exclude the other. Even the idea that the cup marks should reveal themselves as star constellations does not exclude the other explanation, as astrology at this time was primarily a marking of seasons and growth conditions. Knowledge of star constellations and their significance has at this time, when modern timekeepers were unknown, been far more intimate and significant than we think of it today.</p>

<h2 id="gold-horns-and-wheel-of-fortune">Gold Horns and Wheel of Fortune</h2>

<p><em>From 1949-1957 Jorn worked on a book that was titled Gold Horns and Wheel of Fortune. Here he sought through comparisons of images from many cultures for parallels to the gold horns’ pictorial world. Without committing to any definitive interpretations, he saw the figures on the horns as a form of zodiac representation. It took eight years before he in 1957 got the opportunity to publish the book, which contains over four hundred illustrations, collected under headings that suggest central themes in all known myth formations in the world’s cultures. Jorn returned in many of his later books and articles to the pictorial material he had collected in Gold Horns and Wheel of Fortune.</em></p>

<p>My work Gold Horns and Wheel of Fortune (…) goes behind the theological to treat the very fictions and images, which exclusively are what can interest me as an artist. As explanation for their first emergence I use arguments that can be called materialistic, in that they proceed from production life, nutrition and economy as the primary inspiration factors for image formations. I claim that many different animal circles originally existed. Prior to the theological stage, which begins with urban cultures or what is called civilization, I then posit the hypothesis of three other earlier stages among what are called natural peoples, a materialistically characterized magical, a cultic and a mythical stage. The magical, characterized by hunting peoples, is futuristic and teleological in the sense that it expresses great wishes for the future. The cultic, which characterizes farmers, is on the other hand realistic, life-enjoying, in that it expresses the wish to cyclically continue the present. Myth finally characterizes the warrior peoples who prey on the rich civilizations. Their myths are merely backward-looking and conservative memories of a vanished origin and great age. In the North they correspond with a slight shift to the Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. Here it is not a matter of an evolution theory, but on the contrary of an involution theory, for magic, cult and myth continue forward as subordinate elements in spiritual life, except in transitional periods, where regressions occur.(…)</p>

<p>What do I achieve with this systematics? First, I can demonstrate that not only figures from the Gold Horns correspond to compositions in the Babylonian zodiac (fig. 337-338). Their zodiacal character is hereby a matter of course.</p>

<p>Next, I draw attention to a peculiar doubling of the zodiac’s basic figures, which creates a parallel between the figures that mark spring and autumn equinoxes and those that mark winter and summer solstices. The fundamental difference is that the first set is dominated by a female figure (the Virgin), while the second is dominated by a corresponding male figure (the Water-bearer). Since the opposition between summer and winter is of far greater primitive significance and easier to establish than midsummer and midwinter, I believe myself entitled to assume it as the original and oldest seasonal division, which is later supplemented, so we get a fourfold division. This means that the virgin must be older than the water-bearer. Her seasonal division is characterized by the two fish, while it is two twin men who characterize the midsummer division.</p>

<h3 id="the-twins"><strong>The Twins</strong></h3>

<p>The aforementioned alternating battle between summer and winter is found among other places described in detail by Olaus Magnus. On the first of May, two groups of young men are set up in the various towns. They are led by two leaders, chosen by lottery and dressed in winter’s and summer’s costume and name respectively. One dressed in fur coat scatters snowballs and chunks of ice around him, while the other dressed in green and flowers scatters ash and fire sparks around him, carried in sacks and jugs. The two groups, which are on horseback, clash and winter must then be overcome by summer. This and similar customs are known throughout Europe, indeed even known in Greenland, and everything suggests that such scenes are depicted already in our Bronze Age rock carvings.</p>

<p>Although it has been demonstrated that several ancient myths and customs stem directly from here, people have nevertheless wanted to claim that they should be derivations of medieval knightly tournaments and antiquity’s gladiator battles. This is however certainly due to an overestimation of the nobility’s cultural significance and a corresponding underestimation of the common people’s and bourgeoisie’s artistic independence and tradition. By this is not meant that a tradition remains fixed in the same place. It can wander away and come again, but if one carefully examines the attributes and rituals connected to medieval knightly battles and the Roman gladiator games, then one gets in the very highest degree the impression that it is these that contain clear elements of the carnival’s winter and summer symbolism.</p>

<p>Up to our time there still exists another variation of the same duel, in the form of a water game, where the fighters knock each other into the water from two boats. This form is likewise known throughout Europe, connected to harbors, lakes and rivers. This game is also known in depictions from ancient Egypt as well as from Greece and from Nordic Bronze Age. Even up to our time people use <em>in advance</em> to agree who should win, and the two figures have different characteristics, so the presence of cultic magic cannot be explained away. It is therefore meaningless to perceive them as offshoots of tournaments’ sporting festivals.</p>

<p>Everything suggests that people have perceived winter’s and summer’s male representatives as brothers, and the only sensible explanation of <em>the twins’</em> zodiac sign must be that it is an image of the two seasons. From myths and fairy tales we find countless stories about this brother pair, about the Dioscuri, <em>Castor</em> and <em>Pollux,</em> and <em>Gilgamesh</em> and <em>Enkidu,</em> about the Sumerian <em>Lugalgirra</em> and <em>Meslamtae,</em> about <em>Cain</em> and <em>Abel, Esau</em> and <em>Jacob, Balder</em> and <em>Höder</em> etc.</p>

<p>On both gold horns there is an image of a <em>standing</em> and a <em>lying</em> giant, forming a cross or wheel. They can only be explained as a twin sign. But several other of the gold horns’ images seem to be attributable to this double symbolism.</p>

<h2 id="bracteates">Bracteates</h2>

<p><em>One of Jorn’s fields of interest was the Nordic bracteates. He wrote several articles about their pictorial world in 1971, and included two of them in his article collection Indfald og Udfald (Incursions and Excursions), which was published in 1972. Here he attacked the research’s common theories. The bracteates did not need to reproduce myths, they could just as well be sources of inspiration for myth formations.</em></p>

<p>The Nordic bracteates have no origin in a coin system or a state cult. They cannot be defined as religious in this word’s precise meaning, only as expressions of a magical-cosmic nature cult, which must correspond to the general cosmic conception in the North at this time. The bracteates’ Roman origin myth is a sieve that only retains the coarsest. All art in general, I say in general, consists of a part originality connected with traditional preconditions. This applies to Roman numismatics as well as Nordic bracteates.</p>

<p>The one-sided belief in the mythological-religious interpretation has constantly stood in the way of the direct pictorial interpretation of the bracteates, which necessarily must be based on an immediate interpretation of the images as images considered (sui generis). One sees writing and runes everywhere, even where they do not exist, even in this case, where it is proposed about one of the newly found bracteates: “As distorted runes one should perhaps also perceive the spear-like sign under the horse’s hind leg.” No, one should not! One should precisely perceive it as what it resembles, a spear, and note that the hind leg is bent upward and ends in a form quite abnormal for a leg.</p>

<p>To explain this as a misunderstanding of images on Roman coins, as Baltrusaitis does with regard to the detached forelegs on Celtic coins, is an explanation that can be directly disproved by comparison with other coins. From Lancelot Lengyel’s book “L’art Gaulois dans les Medailles” I have drawn a couple of medals, where one sees a sword whose point is directed at one hind leg of the horse, exactly as the spear is directed at one hind leg of the bracteate’s horse.</p>

<p>What this should mean, beyond that they must be the indication that this leg should be cut off, does not concern us here. One can of course make all sorts of tall tales about this process. (…) What is the explanation for these connections? Only more material can reveal.(…)</p>

<p>Over the years much has been written and discussed about the Nordic bracteates or gold medals from the Migration Period.(…) If we are to distance ourselves from the hitherto used failed interpretation methods, we must first specify their guidelines. They can be characterized as the classical direction, of which Mackeprang is a proponent. It can also be called the formalistic, and the opposition to this, which forms the romantic direction, can also be designated as the mythologizing.</p>

<p>The distance we take from the romantic interpretations of our gold medals’ images: Chr. J. Thomsen’s J.J.A. 1855, Worsaae’s 1870 etc. has a different direction than E. Jensen’s classicist attack on this in 1871, where the attempts to interpret the images as reproductions from the Nordic divine world and mythology are characterized as “foolish,” and where all changes in the images that deviate from their Roman-Byzantine models are stamped with the designation “degeneration.” Until today the discussion about the images’ interpretation has been held between these two extremes, and has thus led to absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>The romantic idea that the medal images reproduce Nordic mythology has not been able to withstand the formalistic criticism, which points out the images’ model in Roman medals. But the argument is weak, for the Roman coins and medals also have a foreign model, namely the Greek, which in turn is also influenced by older sources. No one will find it sensible merely to perceive non-Greek, but Roman contributions to the Byzantine-Roman pictorial world as “filling ornament,” which is so characteristic of all primitive art (“horror vacui”) or as “pure and simple decoration.” Why not? Simply because the style is naturalistic. The result of this attitude, which characterizes Mackeprang’s description of the bracteates, therefore becomes only that a naturalistic pictorial form is taken seriously, while the poetic and imaginative musicality in the bracteates’ images is dismissed as random and decadent fantasy on the artist’s part. Medal and coin minting has its artistic history, to which the Nordic gold medals also belong, but if one wants to characterize their distinctive nature, then one must precisely concentrate on the details that distinguish them from all others. This can only happen through an objective comparison, where concepts like decadence are deleted from the dictionary.</p>

<p>The conflict between classicists and romanticists is resolved, if instead of perceiving these images as reproductions of myths, one sees them as sources of inspiration for myth formations. The advantage of turning this causal relationship upside down is first and foremost that it makes it possible to distinguish between image fantasies that are myth-forming and again are influenced in their further formation by mythical ideas, and other images that meaningfully can only be determined magically and cultically, apart from the purely aesthetic outcomes of a personal artist’s creative fantasy.</p>

<p>It cannot, for example, be proven that the Skrydstrup bracteate, as claimed by some, should depict “the wild hunt,” where Odin accompanied by wolf and raven pursues a woman in deer form. The man has a hand in the wolf’s mouth and could just as well be Tyr. Finally, it is not excluded that one may have seen it as an image of King Didrek’s death ride. Where images are created to be able to cover several interpretations, it is no use committing to a single one. But on the other hand it is foolish to believe that these images have the intention of slavishly copying incomprehensible Roman images merely to be in fashion.</p>

<p>“As the reason that the emperor images appear on the bracteates, Sune Ambrosiani states that the emperor cult has penetrated beyond the Roman Empire’s borders.” One might just as well say that the crowning of the bride at weddings shows that the royal cult etc. Nonsense. It is the reverse course that strikes back. Kings and emperors dare not be particularly inventive, and academics forget popular imagination as an artistic source of inspiration.</p>

<p>On the head of some riders there is a peculiar formation that Mackeprang defines as the emperor’s hairstyle with diadem (admittedly degenerated). – Worsaae interpreted them as a helmet. Looking more closely, one will discover that this long-haired hairstyle is provided with a mighty knot, which on more summary images is merely indicated as a coil. On the large, carefully executed bracteate from Asum, Skåne, it is however clearly evident that it is about a braided knot, the one that since Tacitus described it as Suebian “Nodus” has spawned a rich literature. (…)</p>

<p>Martin Blindheim has told me that the custom with a clean-shaven head, where only a tuft was preserved, has persisted in certain areas of Norway. To remove the top was considered cowardice, since in fights one sought to grab it.</p>

<p>In my childhood in West Jutland, a whorl was called a star. I remember that I greatly envied one of my comrades who was called Star-eyes, because he had an incredibly dominant whorl in his forehead hair, which distinguished him from ordinary boys named Anders. Where there is no genuine whorl, a knot can depict or imitate it. Thus I explain to myself the original meaning of the so-called Suebian knot.</p>

<h2 id="middle-ages-and-aesthetics">Middle Ages and Aesthetics</h2>

<p><em>From 1969 to 1973 Jorn wrote a long series of articles about ancient and medieval art in the North, which were printed in the newspaper Demokraten. A number of the articles were collected in the books Tegn og underlige gerninger (Signs and Strange Deeds) and Indfald og udfald (Incursions and Excursions), which were published in 1970 and 1972. Jorn’s articles were a mixture of direct image commentaries and theoretical considerations. Middle Ages and Aesthetics is an unpublished manuscript from around 1969 of a more theoretical character about medieval art’s dual nature. It is followed (page 36) by an excerpt with accompanying images and image captions from the article The Artist Among the Rebels, in which Jorn comments on Otto Norn’s book Jydsk Granit (Jutland Granite) from 1968.</em></p>

<p>In human personal existence there is hardly anything as enigmatic as what we call love. We love, and when we have attained what we love, we forget our love. It becomes something self-evident that we look away from, indeed perhaps we feel it almost as a bond that binds us and prevents us from exploiting a multitude of possibilities we have fallen in love with, and suddenly it or the one we loved disappears without us thinking about it, and then the hopeless love is there again in our consciousness as a searing loss.</p>

<p>It is like with health. This wonderful miracle that everything functions as it should. When that is the case we think of something completely different, are filled with terrible problems, until we get gout or toothache, and then all the other paradoxes have become quite insignificant compared to the gnawing pain. Before the tooth or foot hurt we hardly gave it a thought. Then such a devil comes and makes life a hell for us. We love fresh air, but only with our finger on our throat do we recognize our vital urge to breathe. This is the condition for our passion.</p>

<p>If this applies in our private life, then it also applies in the social. We are accustomed to being brought to our destination by train, car or airplane, and do not think about it unless there is a strike. I am a supporter of spontaneous strikes precisely because they make people conscious that it is not an absolute matter of course that everything functions as it should. It only does so because there are people who take care of this.</p>

<p>One may perhaps wonder what these thoughts have to do with Middle Ages and aesthetics. But for me it is a starting point for understanding what we today have invented to call a Middle Ages and an aesthetics, as if both existed.</p>

<p>Aesthetics is the doctrine of our reactions to sensation, and it is a new doctrine that neither the Greeks, the Romans nor the Christians of the Middle Ages were interested in. Why? Well, one may perhaps stamp me as a romantic when I claim that direct sensory experiences at that time were such a matter of course that no one thought that it could be something to speculate about.</p>

<p>When the German Baumgarten a couple of hundred years ago invented the concept of aesthetics, I thus believe that it was because people in this first period of modern industrialization suddenly got toothache, suddenly discovered that a world was developing where immediate sensory experiences more and more receded into the background, indeed made possible a development where immediate sensory experiences would no longer have significance at all.</p>

<p>Now one must not believe that this recognition has been the basis for the development of what is called theoretical aesthetics, on the contrary. This has hitherto only served the purpose of explaining away the significance of the aesthetic or of people’s direct sensory impressions, in order to prepare the way for an unaesthetic existence. Anyone who wants to learn something about our sensory experiences will be deeply disappointed if he engages with what is called theoretical aesthetics. This label is as false as anything on earth. It only deals with what a well-educated person should perceive as beautiful, even if he personally perceives it as ugly or boring, and what he should perceive as ugly even though he thinks it is tremendously exciting and beautiful. Let us not get involved in that.</p>

<p>Far more interesting I find it when we stick to the precise definition of aesthetics to ask: What conception of the aesthetic did they have in the Middle Ages. I cannot accept that one speaks of different periods’ aesthetics because they merely have different tastes for what they call beautiful. So. As for the Middle Ages’ conception I ask: How did they evaluate immediate sensory impressions, and the answer must be: To Hell, or said in another way as Vices, while they perceived moral intentions as Virtues. This opposition between vices and virtues is a quite new theme in art history, and it is a quite peculiar double-sided art that comes out of it. (…)</p>

<p>The virtues are emphasized as beautiful and the vices as repulsive, but what makes this evaluation so unique that it can be designated as a high point in art history is the strange fact that the condemnable vices are precisely depicted as people’s desire for direct aesthetic experiences, the joy over immediate sensory experiences. If the Middle Ages thus has an aesthetics then it is primarily anti-aesthetic, and we understand then why the Renaissance’s return to antiquity’s way of thinking means a return to recognition of the direct aesthetic judgment.</p>

<p>When this is so clear, it is because the Middle Ages directly used several of antiquity’s sacred aesthetic images as scare images in the way that the same image that in antiquity represented an aesthetic virtue in the Middle Ages was used to designate a sinful vice. (…)</p>

<p><em>An excellent example of the ambiguity in Nordic art in Germanic times. Two mermaids sit apparently gossiping with each other, but simultaneously their tails dissolve into two birds that suckle their breasts, or if you will, into two independent birds, each with a ball in its beak.</em></p>

<p><em>An intermediate stage between them and the Luxuria figure exists as a fragment from Viborg’s destroyed cathedral. Here two birds suckle the breasts of a woman who is simultaneously a tree of life, whose leaves are breasts. Do we not here have the triple interpretation, which divides into animals that nibble the leaves of a tree, Luxuria and the Virgin Mary, as they appear in our medieval art?</em></p>

<p><em>Two carved mermaids. From Nydam II find. Copy, National Museum, Copenhagen.</em></p>

<p><strong>Page 34:</strong></p>

<p><em>The most peculiar image in this series is for me the one found on Ahus church in Skåne. A luxurious lady sits here on a branch of a tree, which is entwined by two serpents that suckle her, while she calmly and composedly rests her head in one hand. She inspires not a few thoughts. I wonder if there is anything like her anywhere else in European medieval art.</em></p>

<p><em>Lazy luxuria woman with hand under cheek and suckling serpents at her bosom. Ahus church, Skåne.</em></p>

<p>The French Zodiaque series has published a “Lexicon of Symbols” in medieval art. Here it is emphasized that prehistoric peoples attribute to their art a fertility-bringing, life-unfolding significance for people, cattle, plants and game, while the Middle Ages’ monks on the other hand found this luxuria, which must be characterized as the directly aesthetic, directly repulsive. All the way through the Middle Ages these two opposite conceptions fought with each other because, as it is claimed in the book with a false modesty, “Christian iconography creates nothing. It places itself in an immense tradition,” which is supposed to go from the Stone Age up to our day.</p>

<p>Naturally there exists a Christian iconography that dominates art for more than a thousand years, and which even today can be found in certain artists’ themes. But there are also many ancient images that pass into early Christian art and which today play no role, while there are themes that remain valid as long as human life on earth has significance.</p>

<p>When we here occupy ourselves with these problems, it is to correct a misunderstanding that the same lexicon comes forth with when it claims that “there is no decisive reason that the real value of these images’ significance or designation has undergone profound changes despite the immense periods of time that separate” their original emergence and their representation in the Middle Ages. This is simply nonsense. One cannot make black into white and vice versa and claim that one has not changed the designations. If the same image characterizes the good as well as the evil, then it characterizes in itself as image nothing at all, unless it characterizes something third, which in itself is neither good nor evil. If we can determine whether for example a lion depicted in the Middle Ages represents virtue or vice, depending on the surroundings in which it is found, then we only learn from this what in the Middle Ages was considered good and evil, nothing about the lion itself.</p>

<p>Norn writes somewhere in the book: “In ancient art the image of the sitting nursing woman symbolized Mother Earth. Thought-provoking, that this pagan symbol emptied of its original meaning and refilled should become lust.” – Here we find Erwin Panofsky’s definition of form as a container that can freely be emptied of its content and symbolic “meaning,” which necessarily always makes the form meaningless in itself. But the artwork is not a kind of bottle into which one pours beer or hydrochloric acid at will. Also in ancient times Mother Earth was an expression of lust, and we even find, to make this more complicated, nursing Virgin Mary sculptures. Norn excludes himself from the possibility of a coherent description of these self-contradictory tendencies’ meaning and comes into a difficult situation when he symbolically must explain that an image of a lion or a serpent symbolizes the good when the church’s enemies are to be characterized. The next step on his path must automatically become Jung’s arche-typology, which will only make the symbolization even more foggy. This naturally does not mean that an expanded insight is excluded in this direction, only that in the direct relationship to the artwork it is completely unfruitful or uninspiring, removes us more and more from the image experience itself.</p>

<h2 id="times-three-faces">Time’s Three Faces</h2>

<p>A few years ago the Jutland yearbook for archaeology, Kuml, published two remarkable granite heads with three faces. One from Gleibjerg and the other from Bramminge. Although the latter is provided with a carved year from the eighteenth century, experts agreed that the sculpture is older, but later reworked. An eye in the forehead on one of the faces on both heads, surrounded by a triangular framing, supports the view that they must be contemporary, but no one has been able to date them.</p>

<p>However, there exists at the National Museum in Copenhagen a bowl-shaped fibula from the Viking Age with four heads, all of which have an eye in the forehead that in form corresponds to that found on the two mentioned sculptures. Unfortunately, however, it is the common view within professional circles that round sculptures in granite first occur in the North at the earliest in the twelfth century, introduced together with Catholicism. This creates a dilemma, for it is impossible to place the two figures within Christian iconography, and the figures have probably never been connected to a church. Either they must be from the Viking Age, whereby some older Nordic Stone Age sculpture must then be dated older than it is, or they must be late pagan reproductions that have preserved the Viking Age’s cultic tradition into Christian times - unless one wants to perceive them as newly invented forgeries. What interest could lie in such a forgery attempt is however enigmatic, and it presupposes that the artist has known and used the rare Nordic forehead eye, which otherwise is not found anywhere else in Europe outside the North, and here is not found in connection with three heads, and which moreover no one has hitherto been interested in.</p>

<p>The museum in Edinburgh, Scotland owns a smaller, three-faced head in stone. Here there is no third eye, but on top of the head there is a hole, just like on a three-faced head from the Migration Period found on Bornholm and executed in bronze. Broby Johansen reproduces in his book “Oldnordiske stenbilleder” (Old Norse Stone Images) a stone head with only one face, which he quite poetically calls the Rossland god. It also has a bowl-shaped depression on top of the head. Possibly there once lay in these bowls a golden ball or similar, which like the grail symbol has been perceived as an eye.</p>

<h3 id="the-forehead-eye-from-india-or-siberia">The Forehead Eye from India or Siberia</h3>

<p>There are many representations of three heads in Europe, especially within Celtic art. But none of them have, as far as I know, a forehead eye. On the other hand this is common on the Indian and Siberian three heads. Of these the Siberian seem to be the oldest.</p>

<p>The old three-faced figure from Mohenjo-Daro has no forehead eye. Did the forehead eye come to the North via Siberia or India? Who knows? E.B. Vadetokaia has in “Les idoles anciennes de l’Iénissei”, Ed. Nauka Leningrad 1967 documented the Siberian finds. A large part of these Siberian three heads with forehead eye are now located at the museum in Minoussinsk and belong to a group of highly interesting sculptures from Yenisei. They are dated to barely two thousand years before our era, and represent a part of a rich and imaginative artistic flowering, which seems to form the starting point also for the Chinese Tao Tié mask, of which the three head thus merely seems to be a particular variant. Even the Romanesque mask sculptures on churches in Europe display this play of variants ranging from three heads to simple column swallowers.</p>

<h3 id="lives-on-as-trolls">Lives on as Trolls</h3>

<p>A typical example of such a variant is the three heads at the bottom of the wooden portal from the Norwegian stave church in Hemsedal (now the museum in Oslo). Another Norwegian specimen in wood is found at the National Museum in Copenhagen. At a certain point it has been perceived as a troll in battle with Holger Danske. Already on the golden altar from Sahl the church had gotten the three-head figure placed as a properly chained devil in Hell. In folk tales he lives on as a troll.</p>

<p>Following the appearance of the article in Kuml, the director of the Stavanger museum published in its yearbook a review of a number of Nordic three heads together with the after-Renaissance popular figures with two faces, often called Prudentia - prudence. Since I do not have the documents here in Paris, I cannot name the authors. But in both cases any attempt at interpretation of these images’ significance is avoided, indeed distance is even taken from the possibility of attributing a sensible meaning to them. It is naturally easier to place them as fallen pagan “gods.”</p>

<h3 id="an-image-of-time">An Image of Time</h3>

<p>Much speaks, however, for the fact that one can maintain the view that the three head must first and foremost be understood as an image of time with its three faces, future, present and past, and that its continued popularity lies precisely in the fact that it gives a visual synthesis of this time division, which all more complicated language forms have once assumed as basic structure for statements about time relationships, a division that over time has provided material for much reflection. The many calendar images that depict January, the turn of the year, as a three-headed figure, as well as all three-head representations of youth, manhood and old age, seem as expressions of this tradition. This significance of the figure can hardly be accidental. Also the triple conception of heaven, earth and underworld fits into this image, since the underworld with the deceased is in itself the idea of what has been, the earthly of what is, and the heavenly of what is coming. This connection is not challenged by the fact that these ideas here are structured from topmost over middle to lowest, thus spatially.</p>

<h3 id="the-renaissances-janus-head">The Renaissance’s Janus Head</h3>

<p>When the three head and the threefold time conception became unpopular in the Middle Ages, and from the Renaissance onward completely disappeared in favor of the Janus head with the two faces and the dialectical idea of the twofold time, this is undoubtedly due to the final victory for the chronological time conception, which had been developed with the Greek-Roman historicism, and which only with the theory of relativity was replaced by a new threefold time conception, where the present is no longer merely perceived as a timeless moment, but as a measurably extended period of time.</p>

<p>With this new time conception a dialectical symmetry idea of past and future has been broken. This had otherwise unfolded a quite exciting hermaphroditic or androgynous symbol world, especially for its pictorially rich explanation of the so-called alchemical opposition connections. There can hardly be any doubt that we in these Yang-Yin conceptions also have a tradition that goes very far back in cultural history, and that they to a high degree supported themselves on a symmetry conception of the opposition between man and woman as fertility principle.</p>

<h3 id="the-christian-trinity-principle">The Christian Trinity Principle</h3>

<p>The three head, which in its Siberian form is equipped with horns and other animal attributes, seems to be an attempt to present a synthetic image of the all, cosmos, time included, but perceived as eternity, the infinite dimension. By temporalizing time, by making it chronologically measurable, the concept of eternity no longer had anything to do with the concept of time. It became idealized and made absolutely divine. But even though the church, which was elevated above the temporal, forbade representing the Christian divine trinity as a human with three faces, one could nevertheless, especially in heretical areas around Switzerland, Czechoslovakia and Austria, not prevent that many paintings of three heads arose, right up to the previous century, representing the Christian trinity. The dispute about these images undoubtedly has a direct connection with violent disputes around the very conception of the Christian trinity principle, which has shaken the church and provoked bloody and merciless wars. It may seem strange that modern science has again opened this old conflict around the time conception, which previously expressed itself in a religious pictorial language, and which orthodox Catholics and Protestants long ago reckoned was finally shelved.</p>

<h3 id="several-variants">Several Variants</h3>

<p>Besides the head with the three faces there are several other variants in the representation of this trinity, for example a truly three-headed figure, where each head has its own neck. Such is the figure on the gold horn. It holds with one hand a buck bound by the foreleg and has an axe in the other hand. It looks as if the animal is to be sacrificed. To the same type belongs the mentioned troll from the National Museum’s Norwegian wooden portal, and the figure with three heads found on the Swedish woven picture tapestry from Skog. A third ancient composition form assembles the three faces in a running movement like a wheel. Such are not known in the North, but it perhaps corresponds to the three running legs. Another composition, well represented in the Viking Age’s art especially on the three-lobed fibula, has three heads whose necks go out from the same center, or conversely turn the hair toward the same center.</p>

<p>A crowned figure with three faces, from an otherwise very interesting astronomical fresco in Eskelhem church, Gotland, has two fish tails like a merman. The lower body is a gigantic mask with beard, and he seems to be drinking from a bowl. A three-headed merman holding onto two fish tails is also found in Basel Münster, Switzerland.</p>

<p>Another remarkable three-headed figure on Gotland is depicted on a fresco from Vamlingbo. It has an en face face with beard, and two profiles each with long nose and growths out of the mouth. A similar theme is found on a wood carving, Gothem church, same place. But where the latter has an animal body, the former divides into two opposed animal bodies with a common, albeit three-faced head.</p>

<p>This version I had not encountered before I now found a similar one at the exhibition of Yugoslav art currently being held in Paris. It was found as an illumination to a medieval manuscript, and bore on its head a column. Can this connection testify to Gotland’s East European connections via Kiev? I cannot pronounce on that. But it was the reunion with this figure that gave me the desire to write a little about time’s three faces and their occurrence in Nordic art.</p>

<h2 id="dalarna-paintings-and-historical-realism">Dalarna Paintings and Historical Realism</h2>

<p>Why does one never find folk art represented in the great books that our art historians write about national art and international art development? Even among critics who pretend to proceed from social and popular interests. One says that folk art is not real art. Neither in its literary nor pictorial form. One calls it folklore, which is almost synonymous with historical curiosities. But when one sees how little the academic circles today understand the unity that exists between people and culture, that culture is a result of the people’s creative power, then one understands that it is a privilege to own art, then one understands everything, then one understands that people cannot see what they do not want to see.</p>

<p>That this blindness has resulted in an untrue picture of cultural life is one thing, and that this development has pushed the creative artists out into an ever greater parasitic existence is another, but that this artistic independence should be an advantage can hardly be true, when the artist to get social work, tasks in society’s service, to be able to work for the people, must lie, formally and in content.</p>

<p>Without analyzing more closely folk art’s cultural significance, and without bringing many historical and cultural data about the material here present about Swedish folk art, I merely seek to show some images I like, images created by people who have had the childlike joy of seeing images, of associating with images, and who have created an image world that corresponds to their needs.</p>

<p>It is not exactly anonymous art, many of these artists’ names are still known today, it is not created by professional artists, but by farmers who had this gift of being able to see images, and who wandered around in the towns in winter, when they could not work with their farming, to make images for the other farmers. This art is like the best Chinese art made by amateurs.</p>

<p>These Swedish wall paintings are painted on paper, lightly primed canvas or on wooden walls with water or oil paint. The most common is watercolor on canvas. Some are made for a specific place, others were rolled up and only hung up at holidays or family celebrations.</p>

<p>The Swedish people love festivities, they understand how to celebrate together, to unite a free and uninhibited joy of life with a solemn, stylish and colorful organization and tradition. It is only in our modern dissolved time that the party has been torn loose from its connection with life’s celebrations. And still today one can in remote areas in Sweden find farmers who live, work and party and celebrate holidays in the same way as these images show, who believe in the same things as the people who made these images, but otherwise this folk culture is dying, also in Sweden.</p>

<p>What did these people believe in? In general one can quite simply see these images as expressions of a naively sincere and childlike religiosity. It is true that these images for the most part are characterized by a biblical mythology, and that they with preference occupy themselves with the oldest Jewish legends. But the treatment of these subjects shows in a peculiar way how this motif world has merged with the time, the environment and the people who created the images. The historical motifs are not perceived historically, but symbolically. Abraham, Isaac, David, Goliath, Absalom, Solomon etc. are not Jews, but Swedish farmers from the 17th and 18th centuries. Art history considers it a realistic progress when the classical artists began to use Jews as models for their religious images and Palestine as background for Christian mythology. This is called “historical realism.” In this strange terminology the Swedish images become unrealistic. Not because they use a foreign motif circle, but because they are not historically correct, as if one could depict anything other than oneself and one’s own time realistically and historically correctly. “Historical realism” is today perceived as an illusionistic immersion in a time that no longer exists, and an environment about which one cannot really know anything real, which in any case one has not experienced.</p>

<p>That the Swedish peasant population could depict the biblical images with such great true realism, and use them as symbols for their own life, undoubtedly rests on the fact that their life organization’s social structure had great similarities with the Israelites’ patriarchal history.</p>

<p>The Swedish farmers’ uncomplicated and rational social attitude shows itself clearly in the depiction of the king, the bishop, the farmer and the farmer’s wife, above which it says: <em>The king says: I rule over you all, and the bishop says: I teach you all, and the farmer says: I give you all food.</em></p>

<p><em>At home sits the farmer’s wife and says herself: I clothe you all.</em> It is as if she appears in opposition to the three great authorities, and as if the painter wants to show us his special sympathies for her. Women have always had a very free position in the Scandinavian countries.</p>

<p>This free tone between the two sexes is also expressed in the image of the young couple in love, who meet by the tree of life. The man greets the woman with the words: “Good day my friend and rose, may I sleep with you?” Or in the humorous drawing of the cuckold and the well-known rejuvenation mill, the youth mill.</p>

<p>If one must beyond this explain what these people believed and put their trust in, then one must say that they first and foremost had a strong belief in themselves, a belief that shows that they identified themselves with both god and king. These authorities have also had their full trust. It is not easy to see whether an image depicts the god, the king or just the farmer himself. The crown, which in most other countries is reserved for the king and queen, is always found in its original way in Sweden as popular ornament at weddings. It was for this people, and at these images’ time of origin, that Napoleon’s general Bernadotte became king.</p>

<p>The images reproduced here are all from the landscape of Dalarna. They are not the best and neither the most typical representatives of these peasant images. This group is specially selected because its mixture of two styles seems confusing, it shows the end and dissolution of an artistic tradition, it approaches a more familiar European style, and is therefore in its language easier to understand. It is easier to penetrate into Swedish folk painting if one enters here.</p>

<p>Europe’s folk art has in the individual countries until now only been treated from a purely chauvinistic attitude. If one examines it from a universally human and international conception, then all of Europe’s folk art shows a wonderful connection and inner unity across borders and stands in a common opposition to the classical art traditions. The difference between a Swedish Dalarna painting and Czech glass painting is strangely small, the poetic content links them to modern American Negroes’ spirituals. The catastrophic opposition between orient and occident that exists in our so-called higher cultural layers does not exist at all in folk art. It is the only art about which one can truly say that it is international in style and content, while at the same time it has its clear local character.</p>

<p>An interesting image element is the strange plant that appears everywhere in this art, a tree with fantastic flowers and arabesques. It is hardly wrong to see in this the universal human symbol, the tree of life, which has gotten its modern parallel in the Christmas tree. A more elementary peculiarity is the pictorial composition form. In contrast to the classical composition symmetry, which builds the image up in static positions, in what one can call dramatic counterpoint, these images are so to speak written in a dynamic progressive composition form, characterized by a wandering image reading, like the popular image series in our newspapers. Words and text attach themselves to the images in a painterly way, now above, now below or inside the image, and they enter into the very construction of the image like Chinese characters or modern joke drawings. The color is clear and strong without subtlety as in a child’s drawing and with the same rich certainty and sometimes even refined brushwork. This dignified progressive dynamic image form without counterpoint and inner dramatic tension is found everywhere in the old cultures, in the Egyptian wall paintings, the old Mesopotamian, and among the Indian Inca and Maya peoples. It is incompatible with classical European naturalism. A typical proof of this is the Roman Trajan’s Column, which is a hopeless jumble of arms, legs, bodies and heads.</p>

<p>But if one looks away from the historical, the general theoretical and formal interests, the stylistic evaluations that can have a principled significance in the future’s form-creating work, what artistic interests can precisely these Swedish images then have for us? Art history does not seem to have found any interest in them. The question is where one finds the artistic values. If one seeks them in the highest formal processing, then it must be admitted that these images have only small value. Their technique is primitive and their theoretical knowledge is slight. But if one seeks the artistic value in the human content, then the question becomes what one finds most valuable in humans. If one seeks like the surrealists the complex and conflict-emphasized, the dramatic content, then one passes by the Dalarna paintings without interest. If on the other hand one cares for the simple harmony, the conflict-free sensuality, prefers this to the inhibited sensibility, then this art becomes some of the most interesting in recent European art history. It is made with the simple superiority that civilized art likes to call childlike. It is easily done, “une peinture gratuite,” as a child can make it, as one usually says. Easily done and happily experienced, thus inferior art, and yet, is it really so?</p>

<p>Is it not actually formally seen the natural image form to be able to express oneself spontaneously, is it not in terms of content the natural life form spontaneously to be able to use one’s powers in a life-affirming work. Is it not actually natural to live a harmonious life and simply and harmoniously to be able to express this life in art. Is this struggle with the painterly material, is this struggle for life, which we today call “living,” is it really life? Natural life is no drama. A birth is no drama, no struggle. It takes two oppositions for there to be struggle. A woman does not “fight” to give birth to her child. She must work, and it can hurt, but a “struggle” it is not, for nothing fights against this birth. The ship does not fight against storm and sea, for the wind and water do not fight against it. It seems to me that this theory of the struggle for life is merely a repetition of the old method of seeing in nature the same as one experiences in society. Earlier times saw in nature a reflection of society: The sun - the king, the moon - the queen, etc. We see in nature all’s struggle against all, our society’s law. Is it correct?</p>

<p>Do these images depict something current? For us modern people they cannot be used as a current social reality, but I like them. That is all I know. I like their content and their form. It is perhaps romanticism, but what can I do about it? When the social reality is not pleasant, I can naturally fight against it, but with what goal? Then I must also have a dream of something better within me. I do not wish to go backward, but when I go forward, then there must exist something I call forward, and that is human joy. Were these people happy? No, they were also oppressed, but not to the degree we are now. They also dreamed of a paradise, but this paradise much resembled a place, some place or other in Dalarna in Sweden.</p>

<h2 id="gjessings-rule---homage-to-a-great-norwegian">Gjessing’s Rule - Homage to a Great Norwegian</h2>

<p>When I in 1961 discovered a multitude of carvings on the churches in Normandy, I decided to publish the photographs that Gérard Franceschi had made in a book. The texts I hoped to get from Nordic and French scientists, but the French did not want to have anything to do with the matter. I reckon that it is because they had not themselves noticed them. This naturally does not explain the whole thing, for they hardly knew properly what they should think about them.</p>

<p>A joyful surprise it was therefore that the Norwegian archaeologist and later ethnologist and sociologist, professor Gutorm Gjessing, who is known for having published the largest part of the Norwegian rock carvings, before he devoted himself to sociology, went to the task and reviewed the material.</p>

<p>He too had to, like me, be struck by the similarity with the Nordic Bronze Age rock carvings. But how is it possible to explain that we find again all these image motifs on the churches in Normandy two thousand years after they flourished in the North? Cup marks, circles with and without crosses, serpents, spirals, ships, birds, footprints, handprints, dancing figures with one hand raised and the other lowered, figures with enormous hands, plowing scenes, deer, cows, horses etc. apart from signs of more recent origin. Could it be possible that the Vikings in the North must have preserved this image world right from the Bronze Age in a now vanished and perishable form of representation?</p>

<p>Despite the fact that this can seem quite fantastic, it is nevertheless in Gjessing’s opinion the most probable explanation. How else should one explain their occurrence? Folk memory is incredibly tenacious, especially in the North. This fact Gjessing illuminates with many examples, for instance the folk legend in Bolling, which told that a wagon with gold had been sunk down in Dejbjerg bog. When archaeologists in 1881-83 began their excavations, they found not just one, but two Dejbjerg wagons from pre-Roman times. For two thousand years people in the area knew this.</p>

<p>But if a tradition is so persistent, why do we not then find the same signs in the North up to more recent times? This was the second question that Gjessing had to give an explanation for, and it is in this connection that he establishes the epoch-making principle that I allow myself to call Gjessing’s rule. He establishes namely that a method or a tradition behaves quite differently in the environment that created it than transplanted in an environment where it is not in accordance with its origin. He says verbatim: “When a tradition is transplanted in a new environment, it is often characterized by a tendency to petrify, to harden and close itself in itself in a completely unchangeable form.”</p>

<p>It is not here a matter of a rule whose consequence is extracted from the material I have laid on the table. On the contrary. It is a gift that Gjessing with a magnificent gesture tosses to me, a consequence of a lifelong sacrifice in the service of recognition of the human, and in the interpretation of the traces that people leave behind.</p>

<p>It may not look like much. The rule is, like so many of the fundamental basic rules that determine our thinking, so obvious that one thinks anyone could have said this, that any researcher knows it, but it is Gjessing who has formulated this rule.</p>

<p>I must honestly admit that neither did I find anything particularly strange in Gjessing’s example, which emphasizes the astonishing conservatism that has preserved the old Nordic language in Iceland and the Faroe Islands. It was first when my French friend Noël Arnaud began to get excited and point out the generally usable in this rule that I began to speculate more deeply on the matter. He referred to the peculiar Renaissance French that is still valid among the French Canadians. Comically enough the examples mentioned here all point to a linguistic rule, but its occasion is pictorial. We thus have here what I will call a designating or semantic rule, common to language and images, independent of both, behind both these phenomena, direct expression of people’s mode of being and acting independently of in which system, linguistic, pictorial etc. this expresses itself. We have here a basic element in a general semantic morphology.</p>

<p>In this way Gjessing’s rule becomes “the missing link,” the sensational connecting link between two studies that previously were incompatible, language study and style study.</p>

<p>The transplantation of a tradition in a new environment applies in time as well as in space. A new civilizational-technical methodology has the same effect as a transplantation from one cultural sphere to another, and Gjessing’s rule applies in both relations. We need only look at the Latin language before and after the Reformation. Before the Reformation it was a common language for a Western European concrete spiritual community. It was then broken and transformed, as every living language is. After the Reformation it became more and more perfected and dead, but what Gjessing points out is that it was perfected precisely because it was preserved as a dying exclusivity for an isolated intellectual aristocracy, what Grundtvig called the black school. Only we must in truth’s name go even further and establish that the same happened with Grundtvig’s thought, when it became an ism, a dogma, a symbolic thinking.</p>

<p>It is here that Gjessing’s rule really grips into the depth of the human spirit, in the description of the transition from sign to symbol. Everything we learn from others without having experienced it ourselves as a human event becomes a symbolized, petrified and closed form. But how many of these petrified forms are we not forced to drag along through life? I cannot go out and kill a person to convince myself of the truth that I must not kill. Gjessing’s rule is a law that characterizes much of what I personally do and think all the time and not just I, but everyone, whether they will admit it or not. The conscious formulation of such a rule entitles in my opinion Gjessing to the Nobel Prize. But see if he gets it.</p>

<h2 id="from-afterword-to-folk-arts-didrek">From Afterword to Folk Art’s Didrek</h2>

<p>What is it that so fascinates us at the sight of images and forms from old times? What makes us listen to aged, distant words and accounts? What happens when we seek contact with these fantasies, foreign to our own dreams, but with which we nevertheless seem to have some secret contact?</p>

<p>In a prelude the poet Wordsworth has compared our fumbling uncertainty in the attempt to look into the elapsed time with the image one experiences seen from a boat on a still lake when one stares into the water, which shades itself in increasing obscurity. One senses a bottom in the depth with colors, forms and uncertain outlines. Reflections from trees, the sky’s clouds, indeed from one’s own face mix into the image, which now and then is distorted by undulating swells to then suddenly for a time completely disappear in a rippling of the surface that comes and goes, one knows not from where and to where.</p>

<h2 id="forord">Forord</h2>

<p>Hvorfor må disse bind udgives? Først og fremmest fordi der ikke eksisterer et samlet værk om kunsten i Nordens fortid, og fordi denne mangel har givet omverdenen det indtryk, at vi nordboere er et ukunstnerisk folk.</p>

<p>Men naturligvis er der flere grunde til, at bøgerne skal ud. Jeg tror blandt andet, at de har noget at give, som ingen andre bøger har givet. Det er en ambitiøs påstand, og når jeg skal begrunde den, må jeg med det samme sige, at jeg ikke har opdaget mange nye ting i fortiden, som forskerne ikke allerede har beskrevet. Men jeg mener, jeg har opdaget noget nyt ved tingene: Jeg tror, jeg kan sætte dem ind i et billede og vise, at de er led i en rig universel sammenhæng - og lykkes det for mig at nå dette mål, da er værket lykkedes.</p>

<p>Jeg mener, en kunstner har forudsætninger for at gøre dette stykke arbejde. Videnskabsmand er jeg ikke, men inden for kunstens område er jeg fagmand. Gennem min kunst har jeg lært at se og finde meningsfyldte sammenhænge, hvor andre måske ikke ser dem. Giver disse bøger noget nyt, da er det en kunstners syn på fortiden.</p>

<p>Fortiden har jeg fundet på lange rejser. Igennem en årrække har jeg rejst fra sted til sted sammen med fotografen Gérard Franceschi og set ting, jeg ikke troede eksisterede. Sammen har vi brugt vore øjne og i en dobbelthed af søgen efter fotografiske motiver og efter kunstnerisk mening fundet frem til billederne. Efterhånden er antallet af fotografier vokset, og foreløbig har vi 20.000 billeder om et tidsafsnit, der omspænder 10.000 år. Billederne siger noget, som bøgerne vil komme til at fortælle: at fortidens nordiske kunst også forklarer nutidens nordiske kunst, at den inderste mening i denne kunst er det sind, som ligger bag alle tingene, gennemtrænger dem og gør dem dybt personlige. Denne sinds-udstråling siger os, at det ekspressionistiske begreb er en tilstand, som det har været naturligt at færdes i gennem hele vor lange fortid, og at vi i Norden er forblevet i denne tilstand under rejsen op til nutiden.</p>

<p>Igennem lang tid troede jeg, at jeg var den eneste, der havde fået fat i dette begrebs nerve, men under mine studier opdagede jeg, at jeg arbejdede videre på et grundlag, som allerede var angivet af danskeren Julius Lange og af svenskeren Johnny Roosval.</p>

<p>Men der var blot ingen, som havde benyttet sig af dette allerede eksisterende fundament. Måske fordi det er vort eget. Måske fordi vi altid måler vor egen kultur i forhold til afstanden til Paris, Rom og Akropolis. Gennem århundreder, ja måske årtusinder, har vi i Norden lidt af en beundrende mindreværdsfølelse over for middelhavs-landenes frembringelser. Derfor har kunsthistorikerne betragtet vore ting som udtyndinger af noget allerede eksisterende. Men vor kunst er ikke provinsiel af væsen. Den har sit særkende. Man kan se, hvordan folk igennem århundreder har bevaret og beskyttet tusinder af kunstneriske arbejder ud over landene ud fra en klenodiefølelse, som røber, at tingene er de fattige folks vidunderlige skatte. Når man betragter disse anonyme skulpturer ved kirkedørene, døbefontenes tunge relieffer, bautastenene på åben mark og træværkets ormeslyng, der bliver ved i et evigheds-ornament - så slår det en, at kunsten er blevet dyrket som noget enestående, og at kunstnerne har investeret følelsen for det enestående i deres værker. Det er ikke en provinsiel udtynding af kulturen sydfra, man møder her, men karakterfulde udtryk for egnens og landsdelens særpræg. De er blevet til netop på dette sted, under disse livsvilkår og blandt disse mennesker og skabt netop for dem. De er tegn, som man tillægger kultisk, mytisk, magisk, menneskelig og kunstnerisk betydning, og henover århundrederne mærker vi stadig, at de repræsenterer selve det enestående, omend på en mærkværdig stilfærdig måde.</p>

<p>Når kunstværkerne mange gange virker beskedne af størrelse, skyldes det ikke mangel på håndværksmæssig formåen, men foragt for det overdimensionerede, det overindustrialiserede og det skematiske, for kunstnerisk reklame uden dækning. Man vil ikke arbejde længere end følelsen rækker, for at tingene ikke skal miste deres indhold og kunsten sin mening. Derfor oplever man kun sjældent det prangende pompøse, og denne intime beskedenhed rummer den menneskelige rigdom, der karakteriserer Nordens kunst.</p>

<p>Når vi igennem århundreder har haft svært ved at finde denne rigdom, skyldtes det, at fortiden blev anskuet af akademiske øjne, som var blændet af klassicismen. Men nutidskunsten har åbnet for 10.000 års fortid. Gennem nutidskunsten oplever vi fortiden som noget varmt og nærværende. Som bevidst ejendom.</p>

<h2 id="olddansk-kunst">Olddansk kunst</h2>

<p><em>I 1949 begyndte Asger Jorn at udarbejde manuskript og udvælge billeder til en bog om de ældste tiders kunst i Danmark, som han ville skrive sammen med P.V. Glob. Jorn gjorde i løbet af nogle måneder sin del af manuskriptet færdigt, og Glob udvirkede, at han kunde samarbejde med Nationalmuseets fotograf Lennart Larsen om en række nyoptagelser til bogen. Resultatet heraf blev en serie fotografier, der på en helt ny måde dramatisk iscenesatte oldtidskunstens genstande. Det fælles projekt strandede, men Jorn havde dog udført en fuldstændig opsætning af sin tekst og af billederne frem til og med broncealderens afslutning. Senere brød han manuskriptet op igen, og føjede nye afsnit ind. Det hele endte som et stort fragment, hvorfra de nedenstående afsnit stammer.</em></p>

<h3 id="jægerkunsten-i-danmark"><strong>Jægerkunsten i Danmark</strong></h3>

<p>De ældste billedfremstillinger, der overhovedet findes i dansk kunst, har man prikket eller indridset i hjortetakker og benredskaber fra ældre stenalder. Den ejendommelige følsomhed, der spores i disse streger og prikker over de blankpolerede benflader, synes egentlig uforenelige med vore forestillinger om primitive stenalderfolk, men måske er disse forestillinger forkerte. Hvorfor er disse redskaber fyldt med billeder, hvad betyder de, kan vi tyde disse budskaber fra de ældste forfædre, der beboede vort land. Der begyndte vor kunst engang for årtusinder siden. Hvad siger den til os?</p>

<p>(…) Indridser man på en genstand billeder af dyr, mennesker eller naturkræfter, da vil disse billeder give den dekorerede genstand de afbildede figurers kraft og egenskaber. Den moderne rent fladeudfyldende ornamentik vi benytter idag rent æstetisk uden dybere mening er et resultat af skriftsprogets specialisering og et ganske ukendt fænomen for naturfolk, hvis ornamentik samtidig er deres skrift, d.v.s. knyttet til deres begrebsverden som udtryksform, så ethvert liniesystem får en bestemt mening og hensigt.</p>

<h3 id="ravfigurerne"><strong>Ravfigurerne</strong></h3>

<p>Finder man i redskabsdekorationerne ingen direkte forbindelse med den almindelige jagtmagi, så synes der dog alligevel at være en kontakt med disse emner i de små dyreskulpturer i rav fra denne periode.</p>

<p>Alene vore perlekæder viser, hvor stærk en tiltrækning de rige ravforekomster har haft på vore forfædre ved kysterne i de ældste tider. Senere skulle det i broncealderen blive den store eksportvare, der betingede vor rigdom på sydens bronce. Let at bearbejde og skønt i sin gyldne transparens har dette stof været selvskrevet til smykker og amuletter. Det er dog tvivlsomt om de her afbildede fire småfigurer har haft denne anvendelse. I deres enkle plasticitet gir de, tilsyneladende fremstillende en gås, et vildsvin, en bjørn og endvidere et ubestemmeligt dyr, et flygtigt billede af jægerens interessesfære. Et ejendommeligt forhold er det, at nogle af dem bærer tydelige brandmærker, ja den ene af dem er næsten opbrændt. Dette kunne give formodning om, at de snarere end at have været amuletter kan være blevet ofret i en slags bålceremoni i forbindelse med et jagtritual, og derfor efterladt halvt fortærede i bålets gløder. Dette lyder mindre usandsynligt, når man betænker, at ravet som den vellugtende harpiks utvivlsomt har været anvendt som røgelsesofre op gennem oldtiden.</p>

<p>Udprægede amuletter er derimod nogle ravsmykker med borehuller til bæresnore. De har også indridset figurer på deres enkle flader. Interessantest er de seneste fund, hvor ornamentet altid består af horisontale linier med en række vertikale frynser. Mange teorier er fremkommet om tydningen af disse kamlignende figurer. Skulle det være fremstillinger af korn med forbindelse til agerbrugsfolkenes Menhirs i Frankrig måtte frynserne vende den anden vej. Måske den største ravklump kunne påvise et sådant slægtskab, men fundet af tilsvarende ilandskyllede ravfigurer fra Doggerbankerne synes dog at føre deres alder betydeligt længere tilbage. At det skulle være tordensten med fremstillinger af faldende regn kan lige så lidt bevises, og nogen direkte forbindelse med broncealderens kamornamenter kan heller ikke påvises. Problemet ligger her som på så mange andre af denne tids billedfremstillinger og venter på en holdbar løsning, men hvordan løsningen end vil blive, så står det i hvert fald klart, at livet og kunsten i denne periode forbereder en brydning, hvis resultater i løbet af nogle få tusinde år skulle ændre menneskenes livsforhold på jorden i stadig hurtigere tempo hen mod en beherskelse af alt levende på jorden. Nøglen hertil var overgangen til den produktive livsform på basis af agerbrug, kvægavl og håndværk. Denne brydning ændrede ikke alene de materielle og sociale forhold, men hele kunstens væsen.</p>

<h2 id="yngre-stenalder-dansk-bondekunst"><strong>Yngre Stenalder. Dansk bondekunst</strong></h2>

<p>Stendysserne og jættestuerne, de store gravhøje fra yngre stenalder, som vi finder rundt om i landet, er måske vort folks mest storladne mindesmærker. Med ufattelige anstrengelser har man opbygget disse jætte-monumenter over menneskeligt samarbejde. Det er ikke nogen forfinet kleinkunst, knapt nok en tildannelse, snarere en sammenstilling af stenblokke. Man ser, at mentaliteten har skiftet og kunsten fået nye dimensioner. Ting og billede smelter sammen til en ejendommelig kunstnerisk syntese. Men ikke alene i dysser og jættestuer ser vi dette. Det præger alle forhold. Også billedstilen er blevet en anden. Det fremgår særlig grelt, hvor man på norske klipper har hugget nye helleristninger oven på de gamle fra jægertiden. Dette brede omslag i billedstilen genfinder vi som nævnt også sydpå.</p>

<p>Repræsenterer den nye billedkunst fra Spaniens og Frankrigs første agerbrugsperiode et brud med den gamle naturalistiske tradition fra jægertiden, og ser vi det samme ske på et senere tidspunkt i Norden, og får kunsten i denne periode et tilsyneladende primitivt og abstrakt præg, da er dette ikke udtryk for en forsimpling, men tværtimod for en langt mere kompliceret og rigere kunstopfattelse. Skal denne overgang karakteriseres gøres det tydeligst ved at kalde den overgangen fra en forestillingskunst til en symbolsk kunst.</p>

<p>Ved en <em>forestillingskunst</em> må vi forstå en kunst, der ser sit formål i at ændre et materiale, så det tilsyneladende bliver noget andet, end det er i realiteten. Lige som en skuespiller ved forklædning, mimik og tale forsøger at omforme sig til en ganske anden person, end han selv ifølge sin natur er, sådan søger man også i det naturalistiske billede så vidt muligt at skjule dettes materielle karakter af ler eller farve for derved at opnå den højeste illusionsvirkning af dyr, mennesker o.s.v. af rent immaterielt forestillingsindhold.</p>

<p>I den <em>symbolske kunst</em> eksisterer derimod ikke denne dualisme mellem stof og forestilling. Den er udtryk for en anden og mere indviklet tankegang, idet den i så høj grad som muligt søger at manifestere tingens <em>egen</em> eksistens, samtidigt med at den gennem analogier forbinder og parallelliserer denne med <em>andre</em> fænomener for at skabe deres syntese. Danseren med tyremasken skal ikke illudere en tyr, men er <em>både</em> sig selv og tyren, en mennesketyr, ja hans tyremaske kunne måske endda være lavet af kornstrå, så han bliver en syntese af korn, kvæg og menneske og derigennem en repræsentant for det organiske liv som helhed. På samme måde kan billedet af f.eks. et hjul i første række være indridset som ornament på et kar for at berige metallets stofvirkning. Det kan endog aftegnes blot som en cirkel uden egere, da alle ved, at det drejer sig om et hjultegn. Samtidig er det ikke blot et hjul, men et billede af den vandrende sol, af menneskeslægtens skæbne i led for led og af årets og tidens gang, af bevægelsen i det hele taget. Søger forestillingskunsten gennem billedvirkninger at skabe den rene illusion, så søger tvært imod den symbolske kunst direkte at manifestere sig selv, at være sig selv som enkeltfænomen, men samtidig at være mer end det, at nå ud til de fjerneste fænomener og forbinde sig med disse. At finde det universelle alt.</p>

<p>Når bondekunsten automatisk føres ind i en symbolsk form skyldes det, at det netop er skærpelsen af bondens sans for analogier, der betinger udviklingen i hans erhverv. Han må forstå, at det korn, der kommer op på marken vil gøre det samme næste år og næste igen, om han omhyggeligt og regelmæssigt pløjer og sår som han skal og når han skal. Han forstår efterhånden, at dette fænomen er identisk med, hvad der sker ved dyrs og menneskers befrugtning. Alle disse ting forbinder sig for ham i en årsagskontinuitet, der giver alt, hvad han arbejder med dette skær af poesi, som er det mest karakteristiske træk i broncealderens og den yngre stenalders kunst. I modsætning til jægerkunstens mere episke tingssaglighed afspejler den hans dybe forståelse af tingenes indre sammenhæng, det, der altid har været poesiens indre væsen.</p>

<p>Bondekunsten er blevet en fælleskunst, er blevet social, dels fordi hans erhverv medfører større sociale sammenhæng og dels fordi hans følelse af identitet med naturen ophæver forudsætningerne for jægerfolkets strenge krav om naturalistisk formgivning. Naturen og mennesket er blevet et, så den ved hvad mennesket ved, og da det ene menneske let lærer, hvad det andet menneske ved, forenkles kunsten mer og mer til letlæselige og praktisk udformede tegn som forudsætter en social kultur, et åndeligt fællesskab, som vi idag har svært ved at tyde, fordi lærdommen er forsvundet, men som dog spænder fra mere realistiske gengivelser til skrift-lignende piktografi. Det er i denne periode skriftsprogene fødes.</p>

<p>Nu rykker mennesket ind som det kunstneriske kærnemotiv, men ikke som individ, snarere som universelt fænomen. På dette tidspunkt skabte mennesket gud i sit eget billede. Intet under at også i billedkunsten interessen flyttes fra fremstillingen af enkeltfænomener til sammenhæng, lovmæssigheder og typer. Tingsrealismen er veget for en sammenhængs-realisme, en geometrisk kunst. Denne benævnelse er i alleregentligste forstand rigtig. Det udtryk for naturens lovmæssigheder, de på dette tidspunkt søgte i grafikken er i virkeligheden det første fundament for den moderne geometriske videnskab, omend formålet var et andet.(…)</p>

<h3 id="ansigtsurnerne"><strong>Ansigtsurnerne</strong></h3>

<p>Blandt lertøjet i sidste del af stenalderen findes en del såkaldte ansigtsurner, der skiller sig ud fra resten ved deres ejendommelige udsmykning med maskelignende hovede. Muligvis har det været krukkens øre, der har inspireret til at udforme de kraftige bryn og sætte øjne under, men efterhånden er der ikke tvivl om, at figurerne har slået an i kraft af deres magiske indhold og indgår som et symbol i den kultiske kunstkreds. De breder sig fra kultur til kultur. Vi finder ansigtsurner nært beslægtede med de danske i de iberiske bondekulturer i Spanien. Ualmindeligt levende er disse runde fugleformede øjne indridsede i rytmiske, næsten nervøse linier i det bløde rå ler. Der er som noget hektisk over dem, som fortaber sig, når vi finder dem igen i broncealderen, men samtidig er også noget af livet brændt ud af dem.</p>

<p>Dette ansigtsmotiv på krukker og kander har været yndet helt op til vore dage i den folkelige keramik. Har man da opfattet krukken som et levende væsen, eller er det det, der har været i krukken, kornet, grøden eller drikken man har anset for levende eller er det en guddoms øjne, der vogter over både krukke og indhold. Ingen vil idag kunne sige det, men slutter man fra normal primitiv bondementalitet ville man være tilbøjelig til at sige både og i kraft af hans specielle naturopfattelse.</p>

<p>Uden at forstå flertydigheden i den symbolske kunst vil det være umuligt at få fat i betydningen af øjnene på ansigtsurnerne. Vi finder blandt de spanske helleristninger og klippemalerier fra denne periode en figur, der med sine dominerende øjne synes at være den samme, som den vi finder på urnerne. Denne figur er indrammet i et fletværk og har tæer, der heller ikke når uden for rammen. I dette ligner den de ejendommelige figurer, der findes indridsede på de samtidige franske stenalderskulpturer, de såkaldte Menhirs. Man har undret sig over, hvorfor man pludselig efter jægertiden havde mistet evnen til at tegne et menneske, så det lignede. Men i virkeligheden må man regne med, at det ikke er et almindeligt menneske, der er søgt fremstillet her. Sammenligner man figuren med de mands- og kvindefigurer, man her i Norden indtil idag har fremstillet af høstens sidste neg, er ligheden slående, lige til det flettede bånd om livet og stråene på ryggen. Slutter vi da, at ansigterne på de danske urner svarer til de nordiske høstkællinger, bliver traditionerne, hvortil vi kan knytte os, mangfoldige.(…) Der er altså gode grunde til at sætte ansigtsurnerne i forbindelse med udenlandske folkloristiske traditioner, så meget mere som vi i museets ansigtskrukke fra det 14. årh. (sandsynligvis af tysk oprindelse) genfinder et dobbeltansigt eller Janushoved, som har givet navn til januar måned og er karakteristisk som årssymbol.(…)</p>

<p>Kan man opfatte ansigtsurnerne som et årstids- og vegetationssymbol, så giver deres forbindelse med gravlægningen tilsyneladende en anden mulighed for tolkning. I broncealderens Kina genfinder vi i samme periode ansigtsurnen som offerskål i form af broncevaser, der blev støbt og ofret i templet for at fremme slægtens velfærd. Øjnene på skålen var forfædrenes, til hvem ofret blev bragt for at de skulle våge over slægten og hjælpe den. Omend en sådan tolkning også må være naturlig for de danske ansigtsurner modsiger dette dog ikke, hvad vi før har sagt. Skal forfædrene have magt til at påvirke de nulevendes ivsbetingelser, må de naturligvis kunne ændre disse. De afdøde må altså leve videre i naturen, forenet med denne gennem jordfæstelsen eller ligbrændingen, og da den primitive agerdyrker som vi har omtalt opfatter mennesket som naturens model og kerne er det ud fra en totemistisk naturopfattelse selvfølgeligt at opfatte de afdøde som indgået i naturkræfternes kredsløb på den ene eller den anden måde. Når man derfor har sået kornet har man utvivlsomt opfattet dette som et offer til forfædrene, mens høsten på sin side var en gave fra forfædrene, ja som deres legemliggørelse. Herved bliver det forståeligt, at det sidste neg som høstes på ageren må indeholde dennes koncentrerede ånd eller dens spirekraft, og at høstkællingen eller manden, der blev lavet af dette neg som repræsentant for de afdøde var en skytsånd, der beskyttede folk og gods så længe, den var i huset, og at den derfor måtte behandles med den største ærbødighed. Kun som en forening af natur og slægtssymbol kan man forstå dette fænomen.</p>

<h3 id="broncealderens-poesi"><strong>Broncealderens poesi</strong></h3>

<p>Der udstrømmer en umiddelbart indtagende ro og livsglæde af broncealderens kunst i Danmark, ikke en stiv og kantet ligevægt, der er ingen hager ved korsene, men en smygende let og levende bevægelighed, hvor dramaets hårde konturer og bratte linjebrud er lykkeligt undgået. Alt flyder og bevæger sig, bøjer sig og vender tilbage som en ungskov i forårsdragt. Det er egentlig ikke billeder af dyr og planter, der gør det, men den indre struktur i selve tingene, der lige som forvandler broncen til en organisk verden, instrumenter og værktøj, såvel som figurer og ornamenter. En sammenligning med den samtidige kunst sydfra viser en ganske anden hård og ofte noget mekanisk-ufølsom stil som i broncespanden med guldskålene fra Italien, hvor kun skålenes yndefulde hanke er danske.</p>

<p>Ingen steder springer denne ejendommelige stemningsmættede ynde så klart frem som i de små kvindefigurer, der er så karakteristiske for denne <em>poetiske</em> kunst. De kan måske i deres symmetriske form minde noget om negerskulpturer, det er ikke menneskeefterligninger, men symboler, og dog er stemningen en ganske anden. Nogle af figurerne er måske i deres værdighed strænge og stærke som idoler fra Kreta, men samtidig ejer de bedste af dem dog en blød gratie, der som i <em>figuren med krukken</em> kan virke ganske jomfruelig. Det er måske ingen tilfældighed, at Virgo, den klassiske himmeljomfru, ofte afbildes med en krukke mellem hænderne.</p>

<p>Kvinden med krukken er ikke et særsyn, men et af kunstens ældste og mest yndede motiver. Længe før man kendte noget til lertøj, i istiden, træffer vi relieffet af kvinden med sit yppighedshorn. Mad og drikke har det altid været kvindens privilegium at varetage, og der er al mulig grund til at dette motiv igennem årtusinder har holdt sig på førstepladsen i folkets gunst. Men der er ikke grund til at tro, at vi her står over for et underdanigt tyende. Det er maden og drikken, der genskaber mennesket, og som sådan i den materialistiske religion omfattes med den højeste veneration. Vi har antydet, hvilken central stilling krukken har haft i natur-kulten, og der er ingen grund til at tro, at det her drejer sig om andet end en kultisk fremstilling, hvadenten kvinden har frembåret sin krukke til et festmåltid eller en ofring, som vi kender det fra det før nævnte majfester.</p>

<p>Er dette motiv klassisk i alder og yndest, så kan det samme med lige så stor ret siges om kvinden, der med hænderne presser sine bryster. Dette for dansk broncealder så karakteristiske motiv findes udført i adskillige små statuetter i bronce. Her er det overhovedet umuligt at komme uden om, at det drejer sig om små frugtbarhedsidoler og moderfigurer, som man åbenbart har opfattet som gavnlige for fødsel og grokraft.</p>

<p>Også sådanne figurer er kendt allerede i istiden. Disse såkaldte Venusfigurer, som f.eks. den fra Willendorf var dog knap så slanke som de her fremstillede.</p>

<p>Både kvinden med krukken eller bægeret og Venustypen følger med i såvel den antikke som den kristne kunst. Den sidste finder vi i romanske granitskulpturer, såvel som senere i træ på barokkens kirkelige udskæringer. Kroppen går her som regel over i en plantelignende stilk eller stamme, så man får indtrykket af, at <em>kvinden er en slags træ eller stammoder.</em> Til tider dier et par fantastiske dyr de spændte bryster. Ser man nøjere efter på den sydfranske menhir vil man opdage, at kvindefiguren også her holder hænderne ind under brysterne. Figuren synes altså i den forbindelse at stå som symbol for naturen og planternes vækst på samme måde som Majen eller juleneget, der sættes op i trætoppen. Vi hævdede, at krukken var det samme symbol som halmkvinden. Kvinden med krukken er i så fald de to elementer, forenet til ét, en moder-natur om man så må sige.</p>

<p>Dette forklarer samtidigt, hvorfor kvindefiguren i gruppen med slangehesten og hornkvæget har store guldindlagte øjne. Her har vi den kvindelige modsvarighed til den før nævnte træblok Torbjørn med metaløjnene. Denne kvindefigur holder kun på det ene bryst, men også til den finder vi paralleller i barokkens danske kirkekunst, hvor den findes så at sige overalt.</p>

<p>At <em>kvinden med guldøjnene har samme symbolske betydning som ansigtsurnerne</em> understøttes af en tegning, indridset i en af de mange smukke barberknive, vi ejer fra denne tid, og hvis billeder har en central plads i broncealderens billedverden. Når vi finder svar på så mange kultiske problemer ved at betragte barberknivenes udsmykning, skyldes dette næppe et tilfældigt dekorativt lune. En analogi mellem <em>segl og kornet</em> på marken og <em>barberkniv og skægget</em> på hagen er af den slags natur-menneskelige analogier, der hører til selvfølgelighederne. Som sådan må også de mange ofrede <em>hårfletninger</em> og smukt udstyrede kamme og kambilleder opfattes, som er fundet i denne periode. Samson-forestillingen om hårets kraft har ikke været et specielt jødisk fænomen. Den barberkniv, hvorom vi i denne forbindelse har talt, viser to slangeagtige dyr med fire ben og manke vendt imod en figur, der næppe kan opfattes som andet end en krukke, en symbolsk sammensætning, vi den dag idag kender fra vore apotekerskilte, og som var et yndet motiv i græsk og ægyptisk kunst. En sådan slangeagtig havhest genfinder vi i forbindelse med øjenkvinden, og det er vel meningen, at den skal die hendes bryst, hvorfra hun med hånden udsprøjter mælken. Når vi genfinder motivet på middelalderens døbefont, det ene af kirkens hellige kar, en genfødelsens skål, skyldes dette, at den har aner helt tilbage til stenalderens urner. Det er vel heller ikke tilfældigt, at vi på et urnelåg fra broncealderen genfinder det billedmotiv, der findes i bunden af de fleste døbefonte, <em>parret omkring træet.</em> Det er jo ikke så lang tid siden man førte de nyfødte gennem et træ eller et hul i jorden også her i Norden. Meget taler for, at de fem figurer, der udgør kompositionen omkring kvinden med guldøjnene har været udstyr til et helligt kar, der er gået til, muligvis fordi det har været af træ. Om det har været et drikkeeller dåbskar eller noget ganske tredie kan man kun gisne om.</p>

<p>En anden lille skulptur, en graciøs akrobatisk danserinde, der i en dristig bue læner sig helt bagover, spændstig som en pilevånd, kan i hvert fald næppe forklares på anden måde end som en del af et kar eller en kande, hvor hun vel har tjent som hank. Denne figur er utvivlsomt skabt efter et etruskisk forbillede, men er dog samtidig typisk dansk både i form og stil. Det elegante lille snoreskørt, som vi genkender fra flere af de andre kvindefigurer, og hvoraf man har fundet bevarede eksemplarer, lader ingen tvivl om oprindelsen, og der er også langt fra de romerske håndværkeres kluntede naturalistiske figurer, der virker ganske malplacerede i forbindelse med brugsgenstande, til den bløde, smidige plasticitet i denne kvindefigur.</p>

<p>Det ville også være naivt at stille sig tilfreds med konstateringen af, at vi her står over for en formel efterligning af romerske forbilleder, lige så naivt som at ville fornægte dette forhold. Vi kender kun altfor godt disse to yderstandpunkter, man ynder at anlægge over for den nordiske kunst. Både brakteater, Ragnarokmyte og meget andet har været behandlet ud fra disse standpunkter. Lad os derfor fastslå, at det overhovedet er ganske uforeneligt med en naturlig kunstopfattelse blot at efterligne en fremmed ting, fordi den ser spændende ud, mens det på den anden side ville være i strid med de historiske kendsgerninger at ville fornægte de klassiske kulturers betydning i Norden. Spørgsmålet er blot, hvordan en sådan påvirkning foregår.</p>

<p>Henrik Ussing siger, at “for folk, der stort set lever i den samme kultur betyder sproglige og etnografiske forskelligheder ikke stort, når det drejer sig om sagn og æventyr, de vil let kunne brede sig fra land til land, fra race til race. Har to folk derimod forskelligt <em>hovederhverv</em> vil forståelsen meget vanskeligere tilvejebringes”. Dette gælder i lige så høj grad med hensyn til kunstneriske motiver. Nordens <em>hovederhverv</em> i broncealderen var <em>landbrug,</em> håndværk og handel, mens det for middelhavslandenes førende kulturer var <em>krig</em> og røveri. Derfor udviklede Nordens kunst sig i en anden kadence end den sydlandske. Det er først i Eddaernes tid, at vi har en parallel til Homer.</p>

<p>Har et motiv ikke en eller anden naturlig tilknytning til hjemlige traditioner og forestillinger, så trænger det overhovedet ikke ind i dens motivverden. Overalt, hvor vi finder et nyt kunstnerisk motiv, er det derfor altid naturligt at regne med to faktorer: fremmede forbilleder og hjemlige forudsætninger, der tilsammen afgør tilegnelsesprocessen, og det må naturligvis altid være den hjemlige forudsætning, der er det væsentligste.</p>

<p>Men hvad er da forudsætningen for denne figur, der ligner en danserinde? Vi finder på svenske helleristninger dansende akrobater, der bøjer sig på nøjagtig samme måde i baglæns spring. Her i landet finder vi først langt senere tilsvarende motiver, i en romansk billedkvader og i fremstillingen af Salomes dans på et middelalderligt kalkmaleri.</p>

<p>Står vi her overfor en fortsat dansk tradition, og er det i så fald en billedtradition eller en dansetradition. Nogen billedtradition lader sig ikke påvise, og da middelalderens kalkmalerier som regel tog deres motiver fra de religiøse skuespil, som man fremførte, og disse igen var omdannelser af rituelle hedenske årstidsmimer, er der vel al grund til at opfatte Salomes dans som en import sydfra, med en tillæmpning til forskellige nordiske dansetraditioner. Dette vil kunne afgøres ved at undersøge, om motiver findes andre steder.</p>

<h3 id="helleristninger-og-processioner"><strong>Helleristninger og processioner</strong></h3>

<p>Broncealderens helleristninger fremstillede utvivlsomt kultfester og giver os derigennem en rig illustration til broncealderens kunstneriske liv. Omend det er i en begrænset periode af broncealderen at disse figurer indhugges, er der dog ingen grund til at antage, at de scener, de fremstiller, også er begrænset til dette korte tidsrum. Både før og efter, ja op til vore dage, finder vi elementer af de kulter, der her fremstilles.</p>

<p>Det mest karakteristiske ved disse scener er deres ejendommelige decentraliserede bevægelighed. I modsætning til den samtidige mykeniske, babyloniske, ægyptiske og kinesiske kunst har man aldrig indtryk af nogen centralfigur. Her som der er det billeder af processioner og optog, men her standser processionen ikke op ved én eller anden figur, som er dens mål. Det er optog og scener for disses egen skyld, for deres egen virknings skyld. Kompositionen er så at sige ubevidst, en lagdeling, der er blevet fyldigere og rigere for hvert år, der er gået. De processioner, der endnu er kendt som fastelavnsoptog, riden sommer i by, St. Hans fester, karneval, jule- og nytårsfester og lignende indeholder utvivlsomt mange elementer, der har holdt sig fra den ældste agerbrugsperiode. De store broncealderhøje, der endnu findes, er ikke gravhøje, men festpladser, der vidner om de store folkelige friluftsspil, der har været grundelementet i den tids kunst, den kilde, hvoraf alle de andre kunstarter har øst, og hvorom det har kredset i natur og form.</p>

<h3 id="skålhullerne"><strong>Skålhullerne</strong></h3>

<p>Hvad er meningen med de skålhuller, der findes i umådelige mængder fra broncealder og yngre stenalder i klipper og sten. Det er hellige symboler, der er ældre end helleristningerne i almindelighed. Der er altså grund til at opfatte dem som centrale i den kultiske enhed, da de også fremstilles i nyere tid, ja benyttes til magiske formål helt op til vore dage.</p>

<p>I Sverige kaldes de ofte elvkværne og benyttedes ofte desuden som offerskåle. Benævnelsen indeholder en tilknytning til både vand og korn, og faktisk findes de fleste skålgruber omkring gamle agre og kilder. Visse løse stenblokke (som den fra Før) ganske oversået med store og små stengruber på alle sider viser, at det ikke har været hensigten at lave offerskåle som de indiske Lingasymboler, omend et slægtskab givet er tilstede. Det har ikke så meget været selve borehullet, som fremstillingen af eller udboringen af hullet, der har været genstand for kultisk vane. Hvilke forestillinger har sat denne proces igang. Der er flere muligheder. Enten kan boringen være en viden fra bearbejdelse af sten, udsprunget af stensmedens kunst, eller også kan det være en overføring af ildboringen i lighed med den såkaldte nødild, der sikkert også har været en årlig fornyelse af ilden, en ny ild. Og endelig kan det kan det som navnet kværn antyder være en efterligning af de primitive kornkværne. Årsagen til, at man har overført denne proces til klipper og sten ligger utvivlsomt i, at den rytmiske kværnen har været opfattet som et frugtbringende erotisk spil. På denne måde er både øksen, ildboringen og kornet knyttet til den erotiske symbolik. Skålen i klippen har på denne måde symboliseret moder jord på samme måde som krukken.</p>

<p>Vi finder på adskillige middelalderlige kirker tilsvarende huller boret omkring indgangsportalerne (bl.a. i Lunds Domkirke). Her er det ikke boringen, men sandstenspulveret, der fremkommer, der synes at have haft den største interesse. Sammenholder man det med almuens udstrakte anvendelse af knuste stenøkser eller tordenkiler som medicin giver dette mulighed for videre tolkninger på samme måde, som den udstrakte anvendelse af skålhullerne til ofringer. Det karakteristiske ved alle disse forklaringer er, at den ene ikke udelukker den anden. Selv tanken at skålhullerne skulle afsløre sig som stjernekonstellationer udelukker ikke den øvrige forklaring, idet astrologi på dette tidspunkt først og fremmest var en markering af årstider og vækstforhold. Kendskabet til stjernekonstellationerne og betydningen heraf har på dette tidspunkt, hvor moderne tidsmålere var ukendte, været langt intimere og betydningsfuldere, end vi idag tænker os det.</p>

<h2 id="guldhorn-og-lykkehjul">Guldhorn og lykkehjul</h2>

<p><em>Fra 1949-1957 arbejdede Jorn på en bog, der fik titlen Guldhorn og Lykkehjul. Her søgte han gennem sammenstillinger af billeder fra mange kulturer efter paralleller til guldhornenes billedverden. Uden at lægge sig fast på nogen endegyldige tolkninger så han figurerne på hornene som en form for stjernekredsfremstilling. Det tog otte år, før han i 1957 fik mulighed for at udgive bogen, der rummer over firehundrede illustrationer, samlet under overskrifter, som antyder centrale temaer i alle kendte mytedannelser i verdens kulturer. Jorn vendte i mange af sine senere bøger og artikler tilbage til det billedstof, han havde samlet i Guldhorn og Lykkehjul.</em></p>

<p>Mit arbejde Guldhorn og lykkehjul (…) går bag om det teologiske for at behandle selve de fiktioner og billeder, som udelukkende er det, der kan interessere mig som kunstner. Som forklaring på deres første opståen benytter jeg mig af argumenter, som kan kaldes materialistiske, idet de går ud fra produktionsliv, ernæring og økonomi som de primære inspirationsfaktorer for billeddannelser. Jeg hævder, at der oprindeligt har eksisteret mange forskellige dyrekredse. Forud for det teologiske stadium, som begynder med bykulturerne eller det man kalder civilisationen, opstiller jeg da hypotesen om tre andre tidligere stadier hos det man kalder naturfolkene, et materialistisk præget magisk, et kultisk og et mytisk stadium. Det magiske, der karakteriseres af jægerfolket, er futuristisk og teleologisk i den forstand, at det udtrykker store ønsker for fremtiden. Det kultiske, der karakteriserer agerdyrkerne, er derimod realistisk, livsnydende, idet det udtrykker ønsket om cyklisk at fortsætte det nærværende. Myten karakteriserer endelig de krigerfolk, der driver rov på de rige civilisationer. Deres myter er blot bagudvendte og konservative minder om en svunden oprindelse og storhedstid. I Norden svarer de med en let forskydning til sten-, bronce- og jernalder. Her drejer det sig ikke om en udviklingsteori, men tværtimod om en indviklingsteori, for magi, kult og myte fortsætter fremover som underordnede elementer i åndslivet, undtagen i brydningstider, hvor der sker tilbagefald.(…)</p>

<p>Hvad opnår jeg da ved denne systematik? For det første kan jeg påvise, at ikke blot figurer fra Guldhornene svarer til kompositioner i den babyloniske dyrekreds (fig. 337-338). Deres zodiakale karakter er hermed en selvfølge.</p>

<p>Dernæst henleder jeg opmærksomheden på en ejendommelig fordobling af zodiakkens grundfigurer, som skaber en parallel mellem de figurer, der markerer forårs- og efterårsjævndøgnene og de, der markerer vinter- og sommersolhverv. Den fundamentale forskel er den, at det første sæt er domineret af en kvindelig figur (Jomfruen), mens det andet er domineret af en tilsvarende mandlig figur (Vandmanden). Da modsætningen mellem sommer og vinter er af langt større primitiv betydning og lettere at konstatere end midsommer og midvinter, mener jeg at være berettiget til at antage den som den oprindelige og ældste årstidsdeling, som senere suppleres, så vi får en firdeling. Dette betyder, at jomfruen må være ældre end vandmanden. Hendes årstidsdeling er karakteriseret af de to fisk, mens det er to tvillingemænd, der karakteriserer midsommerdelingen.</p>

<h3 id="tvillingerne"><strong>Tvillingerne</strong></h3>

<p>Den omtalte vekselkamp mellem sommer og vinter findes bl.a. indgående beskrevet hos Olaus Magnus. Den første maj opstilles der i de forskellige byer to skarer af unge mænd. De blir ledet af to anførere, udvalgt ved lodtrækning og iklædt henholdsvis vinterens og sommerens dragt og navn. Den ene klædt i skindpels strør om sig med snebolde og isstumper, mens den anden klædt i grønt og blomster strør aske og ildgnister omkring sig, medført i sække og krukker. De to skarer, der er til hest, støder sammen og vinteren skal så overvindes af sommeren. Denne og lignende skikke er kendt over hele Europa, ja kendes endog på Grønland, og alt lader formode, at sådanne scener er afbildet allerede i vor broncealders helleristninger.</p>

<p>Omend man har påvist, at adskillige antikke myter og brug stammer direkte herfra, har man dog villet påstå, at de skulle være afledninger af middelalderens riddertourneringer og oltidens gladiatorkampe. Dette skyldes dog sikkert en overvurdering af adelens kulturelle betydning og en tilsvarende undervurdering af almuens og borgerskabets kunstneriske selvstændighed og tradition. Dermed er ikke ment, at en tradition forbliver fast på samme sted. Den kan vandre bort og komme igen, men gennemgår man nøje de attributter og ritualer, der knytter sig til middelalderens ridderkampe og de romerske gladiatorspil, da får man i aller højeste grad indtrykket af, at det er disse, der i sig rummer tydelige elementer af karnevalets vinter- og sommersymbolik.</p>

<p>Op til vor tid findes stadig en anden variation af den samme tvekamp, i form af et vandspil, hvor de kæmpende støder hinanden i vandet fra to både. Denne form er ligeledes kendt over hele Europa, knyttet til havne, søer og floder. Også denne leg kendes i afbildninger fra det gamle Ægypten såvel som fra Grækenland og fra nordisk broncealder. Selv op til vor tid bruger man <em>på forhånd</em> at aftale, hvem der skal vinde, og de to figurer har forskellige kendetegn, så tilstedeværelsen af kultisk magi kan ikke bortforklares. Det er altså meningsløst at opfatte dem som udløbere af tourneringernes sportsfester.</p>

<p>Alt tyder på, at man har opfattet vinterens og sommerens mandlige repræsentanter som brødre, og den eneste fornuftige forklaring på <em>tvillingernes</em> zodiaktegn må være, at det er et billede af de to årstider. Fra myter og æventyr finder vi utallige berettelser om dette brødrepar, om dioscurerne, <em>Kastor</em> og <em>Pollux,</em> og <em>Gilgamesh</em> og <em>Enkidu,</em> om de sumeriske <em>Lugalgirra</em> og <em>Meslamtae,</em> om <em>Kain</em> og <em>Abel, Esau</em> og <em>Jacob, Balder</em> og <em>Høder</em> o.s.v.</p>

<p>På begge guldhorn findes et billede af en <em>stående</em> og en <em>liggende</em> kæmpe, dannende et kors eller hjul. De kan kun forklares som et tvillingetegn. Men adskillige andre af guldhornenes billeder synes at kunne henføres til denne dobbeltsymbolik.</p>

<h2 id="brakteater">Brakteater</h2>

<p><em>Et af Jorns interessefelter var de nordiske brakteater. Han skrev flere artikler om deres billedverden i 1971, og optog to af dem i sin artikelsamling Indfald og Udfald, der udkom i 1972. Her angreb han forskningens gængse teorier. Brakteaterne behøvede ikke at gengive myter, de kunne ligesom godt være inspirationskilder for mytedannelser.</em></p>

<p>De nordiske brakteater har ingen oprindelse i et møntsystem eller en statskult. De kan ikke defineres som religiøse i dette ords præcise mening, kun som udtryk for en magisk-kosmisk naturkult, som må modsvare den almindelige kosmiske opfattelse i Norden på denne tid. Brakteaternes romerske oprindelsesmyte er et sold, der kun tilbageholder det groveste. Al kunst i det hele taget, jeg siger i det hele taget, består af en del originalitet forbundet med traditionelle forudsætninger. Dette gælder romersk numismatik såvel som nordiske brakteater.</p>

<p>Den ensidige tro på den mytologisk-religiøse tolkning har stadigt stået i vejen for den direkte billedmæssige tolkning af brakteaterne, som nødvendigvis må baseres på en umiddelbar tolkning af billederne som billeder betragtet (sui generis). Man ser skrift og runer alle vegne, også hvor de ikke findes, endog i dette tilfælde, hvor det om en af de nyfundne brakteater foreslås: “Som forvanskede runer skal man måske også opfatte det spydlignende tegn under hestens bagben.” Nej, det skal man ikke! Man skal netop opfatte det som hvad det ligner, et spyd, og lægge mærke til, at bagbenet er bøjet opad og ender i et for et ben ganske unormal form.</p>

<p>At forklare dette som en misforståelse af billeder på romerske mønter, som Baltrusaitis gør det med hensyn til de løsrevne forben på keltiske mønter, er en forklaring, der direkte kan modbevises ved sammenligning med andre mønter. Fra Lancelot Lengyels bog “L’art Gaulois dans les Medailles” har jeg aftegnet et par medaljer, hvor man ser et sværd hvis spids er vendt imod det ene bagben på hesten, akkurat som spydet er vendt mod det ene bagben på brakteatens hest.</p>

<p>Hvad det skal betyde, udover at de må være påpegelsen af, at dette ben skal hugges af, vedkommer os ikke her. Man kan jo lave alle mulige røverhistorier om denne proces. (…) Hvad er forklaringen på disse sammenhæng? Det kan kun mere materiale afsløre.(…)</p>

<p>Der har i årenes løb været skrevet og diskuteret meget om de nordiske brakteater eller guldmedaljer fra folkevandringstiden.(…) Skal vi kunne tage afstand fra de hidtil anvendte mislykkede tolkningsmetoder må vi først præcisere deres retningslinjer. De kan karakteriseres som den klassiske retningslinie, som Mackeprang er tilhænger af. Den kan også kaldes den formalistiske, og modsætningen hertil, der danner den romantiske retningslinje, kan også betegnes som den mytologiserende.</p>

<p>Den afstand vi tager fra de romantiske tolkninger af vore guldmedaljers billeder: Chr. J. Thomsens J.J.A. 1855, Worsaaes 1870 etc. har en anden retning end E. Jensens klassicistiske angreb herpå i 1871, hvor forsøgene på at tolke billederne som gengivelser fra den nordiske gudeverden og mytologi karakteriseres som “naragtige”, og hvor alle ændringer i billederne, som afviger fra deres romersk-byzantinske modeller, stemples med betegnelsen “degeneration”. Indtil i dag har diskussionen om billedernes tolkning været holdt mellem disse to yderpunkter, og har altså ikke ført til noget som helst.</p>

<p>Den romantiske forestilling, at medaljebillederne gengiver nordisk mytologi, har ikke kunnet stå for den formalistiske kritik, der påpeger billedernes model i romerske medaljer. Men argumentet er svagt, for også de romerske mønter og medaljer har en fremmed model, nemlig den græske, som på sin side også er påvirket af ældre kilder. Ingen vil finde det fornuftigt blot at opfatte ikke-græske, men romerske bidrag til den byzantinsk-romerske billedverden som “fyldornamentik”, som er så karakteristisk for al primitiv kunst (“horror vacui”) eller som “ren og skær dekoration”. Hvorfor ikke? Blot fordi stilen er naturalistisk. Resultatet af denne indstilling, der karakteriserer Mackeprangs beskrivelse af brakteaterne, bliver derfor kun den, at en naturalistisk billedform tages alvorligt, mens den poetiske og fantasifulde musikalitet i brakteaternes billeder affærdiges som tilfældig og dekadent fantasi fra kunstnerens side. Medalje- og møntprægningen har sin kunstneriske historie, hvortil også de nordiske guldmedaljer hører, men vil man karakterisere deres særegne væsen, da må man netop samle sig om de detaljer, der adskiller dem fra alle andre. Dette kan kun ske ved en objektiv sammenligning, hvor begreber som dekadence stryges af ordbogen.</p>

<p>Konflikten mellem klassikere og romantikere opløses, om man i stedet for at opfatte disse billeder som gengivelser af myter, ser dem som inspirationskilder for mytedannelser. Fordelen ved at vende dette årsagsforhold på hovedet er først og fremmest det, at det muligggør, at man kan skelne mellem billedfantasier, som er mytedannende og igen påvirkes i deres videre udformning af mytiske forestillinger, og andre billeder, som betydningsmæssigt kun kan bestemmes magisk og kultisk, bortset fra de rent æstetiske udslag af en personlig kunstners skabende fantasi.</p>

<p>Det kan f. eks. ikke bevises, at Skrydstrupbrakteaten, som påstået af nogen, skal fremstille “den vilde jagt”, hvor Odin ledsaget af ulv og ravn forfølger en kvinde i hjorteskikkelse. Manden har en hånd i ulvens gab og kan lige så godt være Tyr. Endelig er det ikke udelukket, at man kan have set det som et billede af kong Didreks dødsridt. Hvor billeder er skabt for at kunne dække flere tydninger, nytter det ikke at lægge sig fast på en enkelt. Men det er på den anden side tåbeligt at tro, at disse billeder har til hensigt slavisk af kopiere uforståede romerske billeder blot for at være med på noderne.</p>

<p>“Som årsag til, at kejserbillederne forekommer på brakteaterne, angiver Sune Ambrosiani, at kejserkulten er trængt ud over romerrigets grænser.” Man kan lige så godt sige, at brudekroning ved bryllupviser, at kongekulten o.s.v. Vrøvl. Det er det omvendte forløb, som slår tilbage. Konger og kejsere tør ikke være særlig opfindsomme, og akademikerne glemmer folkefantasien som kunstnerisk inspirationskilde.</p>

<p>På hovedet af en del ryttere findes der en ejendommelig formation, som Mackeprang definerer som kejserfrisuren med diadem (ganske vist degenereret). – Worsaae tolkede dem som en hjælm. Ser man nærmere til, vil man opdage, at denne langhårede frisure er forsynet med en mægtig knude, der på mere summariske billeder blot er antydet som en slyngning. På den store, omhyggeligt udførte brakteat fra Asum, Skåne, fremgår det dog tydeligt, at det drejer sig om en sammenflettet knude, den der siden Tacitus beskrev den som suebisk “Nodus” har affødt en rig litteratur. (…)</p>

<p>Martin Blindheim har fortalt mig, at skikken med glatraget hoved, hvor kun en tot blev bevaret, har holdt sig i visse egne af Norge. At fjerne toppen regnedes for fejhed, da man i slagsmål søgte at gribe efter den.</p>

<p>I min barndom kaldte man i Vestjylland en hvirvel for en stjerne. Jeg husker, at jeg stærkt misundte en af mine kammerater, der blev kaldt Stjærnajes, fordi han havde en utroligt fremherskende hvirvel i pandehåret, som skilte ham fra almindelige drenge ved navn Anders. Hvor der ikke findes en ægte hvirvel, der kan en knude afbilde eller eftergøre den. Sådan forklarer jeg mig den oprindelige mening med den såkaldte Sueverknude.</p>

<h2 id="middelalder-og-æstetik">Middelalder og æstetik</h2>

<p><em>Fra 1969 til 1973 skrev Jorn en lang række artikler om oldtids- og middelalderkunsten i Norden, som blev trykt i avisen Demokraten. En del af artiklerne blev samlet i bøgerne Tegn og underlige gerninger og Indfald og udfald, der udkom i 1970 og 1972. Jorns artikler var en blanding af direkte billedkommentarer og teoretiske overvejelser. Middelalder og æstetik er et utrykt manuskript fra omkring 1969 af mere teoretisk karakter om middelalderkunstens dobbelte væsen. Den følges (side 36) af et uddrag med tilhørende billeder og billedtekster fra artiklen Kunstneren mellem oprørerne, hvori Jorn kommenterer Otto Norns bog Jydsk Granit fra 1968.</em></p>

<p>I menneskets personlige tilværelse findes der næppe noget så gådefuldt som det vi kalder kærligheden. Vi elsker, og har vi opnået, hvad vi elsker glemmer vi vor kærlighed. Det bliver noget selvfølgeligt, som vi ser bort fra, ja måske føler vi det nærmest som et bånd, der binder os og forhindrer os i at udnytte en mængde muligheder, som vi har forelsket os i, og pludselig forsvinder det eller den vi elskede uden at vi tænkte over det, og da er den håbløse kærlighed der igen i vor bevidsthed som et skærende savn.</p>

<p>Det er som med sundheden. Dette vidunderlige mirakel, at alt fungerer som det skal. Når det er tilfældet tænker vi på noget helt andet, er opfyldt af frygtelige problemer, indtil vi får podagra eller tandpine, og så er alle de andre paradoxer blevet ganske ligegyldige i forhold til den gnavende smerte. Før end tanden eller foden gjorde ondt skænkede vi den næppe en tanke. Så kommer sådan en satan og gør livet til et helvede for os. Vi elsker frisk luft, men kun med fingren på struben erkender vi vor vitale trang til at trække vejret. Dette er betingelsen for vor lidenskab.</p>

<p>Gælder dette i vort private liv, da gælder det også i det sociale. Vi er vant til at blive bragt til vort mål med tog, bil eller flyver, og tænker ikke over det med mindre der strejkes. Jeg er tilhænger af spontane strejker netop fordi de gør menneskene bevidste, at det ikke er en absolut selvfølgelighed, at alt fungerer som det skal. Det gør det kun fordi der er mennesker, der sørger herfor.</p>

<p>Man vil måske undre sig over, hvad disse tanker har med middelalder og æstetik at gøre. Men for mig er det et udgangspunkt til forståelse af det vi idag har fundet på at kalde en middelalder og en æstetik, som om begge dele eksisterede.</p>

<p>Æstetik er læren om vore reaktioner over for sansning, og det er en ny lære, som hverken grækerne, romerne eller middelalderens kristne interesserede sig for. Hvorfor? Ja, man vil måske stemple mig som romantiker, når jeg påstår, at direkte sanseoplevelser på den tid var en så selvfølgelig sag, at ingen tænkte på, at det kunne være noget at spekulere på.</p>

<p>Når tyskeren Baumgarten for et par hundrede år siden opfandt begrebet æstetik mener jeg altså, at det skyldes, at menneskene i denne første periode af den moderne industrialisering pludselig fik tandpine, pludselig opdagede, at der udviklede sig en verden, hvor de umiddelbare sanseoplevelser mer og mer trådte i baggrunden, ja muliggjorde en udvikling, hvor de umiddelbare sanseoplevelser overhovedet ikke mere ville få betydning.</p>

<p>Nu må man ikke tro, at denne erkendelse har været grundlaget for udviklingen af det man kalder den teoretiske æstetik, tvært imod. Denne har hidtil kun tjent det formål at bortforklare betydningen af det æstetiske eller af menneskenes direkte sanseindtryk, for at berede vejen for en uæstetisk tilværelse. Enhver der vil lære noget om vore sanseoplevelser vil blive dybt skuffet, om han giver sig i lag med det man kalder teoretisk æstetik. Denne etikette er så falsk som noget på jorden. Den handler kun om, hvad et velopdragent menneske skal opfatte som skønt, selv om han personligt opfatter det som grimt eller kedeligt, og hvad han skal opfatte som grimt selv om han synes, at det er mægtigt spændende og skønt. Lad os ikke blande os i det.</p>

<p>Langt interessantere finder jeg det, når vi holder os til den præcise definition af æstetikken at spørge: Hvilken opfattelse af det æstetiske havde man i middelalderen. Jeg kan ikke acceptere, at man taler om forskellige perioders æstetik fordi de blot har forskellig smag for, hvad de kalder skønt. Altså. Hvad middelalderens opfattelse angår spørger jeg: Hvordan vurderede de umiddelbare sanseindtryk, og svaret må blive: Ad Helvedet til, eller sagt på en anden måde som Laster, mens de opfattede moralske hensigter som Dyder. Denne modsætning mellem laster og dyder er et ganske nyt tema i kunsthistorien, og det er en ganske ejendommelig dobbeltsidig kunst, der kommer ud af det. (…)</p>

<p>Dyderne fremhæves som skønne og lasterne som modbydelige, men det der gør denne vurdering så enestående at den kan betegnes som et højdepunkt i kunstens historie, det er det mærkværdige at de fordømmelige laster netop afbildes som menneskenes lyst til direkte æstetiske oplevelser, glæden over umiddelbare sanseoplevelser. Har middelalderen altså en æstetik da er den primært anti-æstetisk, og vi forstår da hvorfor renæssancens tilbagevenden til antikkens tankegang betyder en tilbagevenden til anerkendelse af den direkte æstetiske dom.</p>

<p>Når dette er så tydeligt da skyldes det, at middelalderen direkte benyttede flere af antikkens hellige æstetiske billeder som skræmmebilleder på den måde at det samme billede som i antikken repræsenterede en æstetisk dyd i middelalderen blev anvendt til at betegne en syndig last. (…)</p>

<p><em>Et fremragende eksempel på flertydigheden i den nordiske kunst i germansk tid. To havfruer sidder tilsyneladende og sladrer med hinanden, men samtidig hermed opløses deres haler i to fugle, der dier deres bryster, eller om man vil, i to selvstændige fugle, hver med en kugle i næbbet.</em></p>

<p><em>Et mellemstadium mellem dem og Luxuriafiguren findes som et fragment fra Viborg ødelagte domkirke. Her dier to fugle brysterne på en kvinde, der samtidigt er et livstræ, hvis blade er bryster. Mon vi ikke her har den tredobbelte tolkning, som deler sig i dyr, der nipper af bladene på et træ, Luxuria og jomfru Maria, som de aftegner sig i vor middelalderkunst?</em></p>

<p><em>To udskårne havfruer. Fra Nydam II fundet. Kopi, Nationalmuseet, København.</em></p>

<p><strong>Side 34:</strong></p>

<p><em>Det ejendommeligste billede i denne serie er for mig det, der findes på Ahus kirke i Skåne. En luxuøs dame sidder her på en gren af et træ, som er omslynget af to slanger der dier hende, mens hun i ro og mag støtter hovedet i den ene hånd. Hun inspirerer til ikke så få tanker. Jeg gad vide, om der findes mage til hende nogen andre steder i europæisk middelalderkunst.</em></p>

<p><em>Doven luxuriakvinde med hånd under kind og diende slanger ved sin barm. Ahus kirke, Skåne.</em></p>

<p>Den franske Zodiaque-serie har udsendt et “Lexikon over Symboler” i middelalderkunsten. Her fremhæves at forhistoriske folk tillægger deres kunst en frugtbringende, livsudfoldende betydning for mennesker, kvæg, planter og vildt, mens middelalderens munke derimod fandt dette luxurie, som må betegnes som det direkte æstetiske for direkte modbydeligt. Hele vejen op gennem middelalderen kæmpede disse to modsatte opfattelser med hinanden fordi, som det i bogen påstås med en falsk beskedenhed, “Den kristne ikonografi skaber intet. Den placerer sig i en umådelig tradition”, der skal gå fra stenalderen op til vore dage.</p>

<p>Selvfølgelig eksisterer der en kristen ikonografi, som behersker kunsten i mer end tusinde år, og som selv den dag idag kan genfindes i visse kunstneres temaer. Men der findes også mange antikke billeder, der overgår i den tidligere kristne kunst, og som idag ingen rolle spiller, mens der findes temaer, der forbliver gyldige så længe menneskenes liv på jorden har betydning.</p>

<p>Når vi her beskæftiger os med disse problemer, da er det for at rette en misforståelse, som det samme lexikon fremkommer med idet det påstår, at “der er ingen afgørende grund til, at den reelle værdi af disse billeders betydning eller betegnelse har undergået dybtgående ændringer på trods af de umådelige tidsrum der adskiller” deres oprindelige fremkomst og deres fremstilling i middelalderen. Dette er simpelthen vrøvl. Man kan ikke gøre sort til hvidt og omvendt og påstå, at man ikke har lavet om på betegnelserne. Hvis det samme billede kendetegner det gode såvel som det onde, da kendetegner det i sig selv som billede intet som helst, om det ikke kendetegner noget tredie, som i sig selv hverken er godt eller ondt. Kan vi afgøre, om f.eks. en løve fremstillet i middelalderen repræsenterer dyden eller lasten, alt efter de omgivelser hvori den befinder sig, da lærer vi deraf blot, hvad man i middelalderen anså for godt og ondt, intet om selve løven.</p>

<p>Norn skriver et sted i bogen: “I oldtidens kunst symboliserede billedet af den siddende diegivende kvinde Moder Jord. Tankevækkende, at dette hedenske symbol tømt for sin oprindelige mening og fyldt påny skulle blive til vellysten”. – Her finder vi Erwin Panofskys definition af formen som en beholder, der frit kan tømmes for sit indhold og symbolske “mening”, der nødvendigvis altid gør formen meningsløs i sig selv. Men kunstværket er ikke en slags flaske, hvori man hælder øl eller saltsyre efter behag. Også i oldtiden var Moder Jord udtryk for vellyst, og vi finder endog, for at gøre dette mere kompliceret, diegivende jomfru Maria-skulpturer. Norn udelukker sig fra muligheden for en sammenhængende beskrivelse af disse selvmodsigende tendensers mening og kommer i en vanskelig situation, når han symbolsk skal forklare, at et billede af en løve eller en slange symboliserer det gode, når kirkens fjender skal karakteriseres. Det næste skridt på hans vej må automatisk blive Jungs arche-typologi, hvad der kun vil gøre symboliseringen endnu mere tåget. Dette betyder naturligvis ikke, at en udvidet indsigt er udelukket i denne retning, blot at den i det direkte forhold til kunstværket er komplet ufrugtbar eller uinspirerende, fjerner os mer og mer fra selve billedoplevelsen.</p>

<p>For nogle år siden offentliggjorde det jyske årsskrift for arkæologi, Kuml, to mærkværdige granithoveder med tre ansigter. Det ene fra Gleibjerg og det andet fra Bramminge. Omend det sidste er forsynet med et udhugget årstal fra det attende århundrede, var eksperter enige om, at skulpturen er ældre, men senere forhugget. Et øje i panden på et af ansigterne på begge hoveder, omgivet af en trekantet indramning, støtter den opfattelse, at de må være samtidige, men ingen har kunnet tidsfæste dem.</p>

<p>Der findes dog på Nationalmuseet i København en skålformet fibula fra vikingetiden med fire hoveder, der alle i panden har et øje, som i form svarer til det, der findes på de to omtalte skulpturer. Det er dog desværre den almindelige opfattelse inden for fagkredse, at rundskulpturer i granit først forekommer i Norden tidligst i det tolvte århundrede, indført sammen med katolicismen. Dette fremkalder et dilemma, for det er umuligt at placere de to figurer inden for kristen ikonografi, og figurerne har nok aldrig været tilknyttet en kirke. Enten må de være fra vikingetiden, hvorved en del ældre nordisk stenalderskulptur da må dateres ældre end det gøres, eller også må de være sene hedenske gengivelser, der har bevaret vikingetidens kultiske tradition ind i kristen tid - om man da ikke vil opfatte dem som nyopfundne forfalskninger. Hvilken interesse, der kunne ligge i et sådant forfalskningsforsøg er dog gådefuldt, og det forudsætter, at kunstneren har kendt og anvendt det sjældne nordiske pandeøje, som ellers ikke findes nogen andre steder i Europa uden for Norden, og her ikke findes i forbindelse med trehoveder, og som for øvrigt ingen hidtil har interesseret sig for.</p>

<p>Museet i Edinburgh, Skotland ejer et mindre, treansigtet hoved i sten. Her findes intet tredje øje, men oven i hovedet er der et hul, ligesom på et treansigtet hoved fra folkevandringstiden fundet på Bornholm og udført i bronze. Broby Johansen gengiver i sin bog “Oldnordiske stenbilleder” et stenhoved kun med ét ansigt, som han meget poetisk kalder Rosslandsguden. Den har også en skålformet fordybning oven i hovedet. Muligvis har der i disse skåle engang ligget en gylden kugle eller lignende, der i lighed med gral-symbolet er blevet opfattet som et øje.</p>

<h3 id="pandeøjet-fra-indien-eller-sibirien">Pandeøjet fra Indien eller Sibirien</h3>

<p>Der findes mange fremstillinger af trehoveder i Europa, specielt inden for keltisk kunst. Men ingen af dem har, så vidt jeg ved, et pandeøje. Derimod er dette almindeligt på de indiske og sibiriske trehoveder. Af disse synes de sibiriske at være de ældste.</p>

<p>Den gamle treansigtede figur fra Mohenjo-Daro har intet pandeøje. Er pandeøjet kommet til Norden over Sibirien eller Indien? Hvem ved? E.B. Vadetokaia har i “Les idoles anciennes de l’Iénissei”, Ed. Nauka Leningrad 1967 oplyst de sibiriske fund. En stor del af disse sibiriske trehoveder med pandeøje befinder sig nu på museet i Minoussinsk og hører til en gruppe højst interessante skulpturer fra lénissei. De er dateret til knapt to tusinde år før vor tidsregning, og repræsenterer en del af en rig og fantasifuld kunstnerisk blomstring, som synes at danne udgangspunkt også for den kinesiske Tao Tié-maske, hvoraf trehovedet da blot synes at være en særlig variant. Selv de romanske maskeskulpturer på kirkerne i Europa fremviser dette spil af varianter lige fra trehoveder til enkle søjleslugere.</p>

<h3 id="lever-videre-som-trolde">Lever videre som trolde</h3>

<p>Et typisk eksempel på en sådan variant er de tre hoveder nederst på træportalen fra den norske stavkirke i Hemsedal (nu museet i Oslo). Et andet norsk eksemplar i træ findes på Nationalmuseet i København. På et vist tidspunkt er det blevet opfattet som en trold i kamp med Holger Danske. Allerede på det gyldne alter fra Sahl havde kirken fået trehovedfiguren anbragt som en forsvarlig lænket djævel i Helvede. I folkesagn lever han videre som trold.</p>

<p>Efter fremkomsten af artiklen i Kuml offentliggjorde direktøren for Stavanger museum i dettes årsskrift en gennemgang af en række nordiske trehoveder sammen med de efter renæssancen populære figurer med to ansigter, ofte kaldet Prudentia - forsigtighed. Da jeg ikke her i Paris har dokumenterne, kan jeg ikke navngive forfatterne. Men i begge tilfælde undgås ethvert forsøg på tolkning af disse billeders betydning, ja der tages endog afstand fra muligheden for at tillægge dem en fornuftig mening. Det er naturligvis lettere at placere dem som faldne hedenske “guder”.</p>

<h3 id="et-billede-af-tiden">Et billede af tiden</h3>

<p>Meget taler dog for, at man kan fastholde opfattelsen, at trehovedet først og fremmest må forstås som et billede af tiden med dens tre ansigter, fremtid, nutid og fortid, og at dets fortsatte popularitet netop ligger i, at det giver en visuel syntese af denne tidsinddeling, som alle mere komplicerede sprogformer engang har antaget som grundstruktur for udtalelser om tidsforhold, en inddeling, der i tidens løb har givet stof til megen eftertanke. De mange kalenderbilleder, der fremstiller januar, årsskiftet, som en trehovedet figur, såvel som alle trehovedfremstillinger af ungdom, manddom og alderdom, virker som udtryk for denne tradition. Denne betydning af figuren kan vanskeligt være tilfældig. Også den tredobbelte opfattelse af himmel, jord og underverden passer ind i dette billede, da underverdenen med de afdøde i sig selv er forestillingen om det, der har været, det jordiske om det, der er, og det himmelske om det kommende. Dette sammenhæng anfægtes ikke af, at disse forestillinger her bliver struktureret fra øverst over mellemst til nederst, altså rumligt.</p>

<h3 id="renæssancens-janushoved">Renæssancens Janushoved</h3>

<p>Når trehovedet og den tredelte tidsopfattelse blev upopulær i middelalderen, og fra og med renæssancen helt og holdent forsvandt til fordel for Janushovedet med de to ansigter og den dialektiske forestilling om den todelte tid, skyldes dette utvivlsom den endelige sejr for den kronologiske tidsopfattelse, som var blevet udviklet med den græsk-romerske historisme, og som først med relativitetsteorien afløstes af en ny tredelt tidsopfattelse, hvor nutiden ikke længere blot opfattes som et tidsløst øjeblik, men som et måleligt udbredt tidsrum.</p>

<p>Med denne nye tidsopfattelse er en dialektisk symmetriforestilling af fortid og fremtid blevet brudt. Denne havde ellers udfoldet en ganske spændende hermafroditisk eller androgyn symbolverden, specielt til sin billedrige forklaring af de såkaldte alkymistiske modsætningssammenhæng. Der kan næppe herske tvivl om, at vi i disse Yang-Yin-forestillinger også har en tradition, der går meget langt tilbage i kulturhistorien, og at de i høj grad støttede sig til en symmetriopfattelse af modsætningen mellem mand og kvinde som frugtbarhedsprincip.</p>

<h3 id="det-kristne-tre-enighedsprincip">Det kristne tre-enighedsprincip</h3>

<p>Trehovedet, der i sin sibiriske form er udstyret med horn og andre dyriske attributter, synes at være et forsøg på at fremstille et syntetisk billede af altet, kosmos, tiden iberegnet, men opfattet som evigheden, den uendelige dimension. Ved at timeliggøre tiden, ved at gøre den kronologisk målelig, fik evighedsbegrebet ikke længere noget at gøre med tidsbegrebet. Det blev idealiseret og gjort absolut guddommeligt. Men selv om det så af kirken, der var hævet over det timelige, blev forbudt at fremstille den kristne guddommelige treenighed som et menneske med tre ansigter, kunne man dog specielt i kætterske områder omkring Svejts, Czekoslovakiet og Østrig ikke forhindre, at der opstod mange malerier af trehoveder, helt op til forrige århundrede, fremstillende den kristne treenighed. Striden om disse billeder har utvivlsomt en direkte sammenhæng med voldsomme stridigheder omkring selve opfattelsen af det kristne treenighedsprincip, som har rystet kirken og fremkaldt blodige og skånselsløse krige. Det kan virke besynderligt, at den moderne naturvidenskab igen har åbnet denne gamle konflikt omkring tidsopfattelsen, der tidligere udtrykte sig i et religiøst billedsprog, og som ortodokse katolikker og protestanter forlængst regnede med var endeligt skrinlagt.</p>

<h3 id="flere-varianter">Flere varianter</h3>

<p>Foruden hovedet med de tre ansigter findes der flere andre varianter i fremstillingen af denne treenighed, f.eks. en virkelig trehovedet figur, hvor hvert hoved har sin egen hals. Sådan er figuren på guldhornet. Den holder med den ene hånd en buk bundet med forbenet og har en økse i den anden hånd. Det ser ud, som om dyret skal ofres. Til samme type hører den omtalte trold fra Nationalmuseets norske træportal, og den figur med tre hoveder, som findes på det svenske vævede billedtæppe fra Skog. En tredje antik kompositionsform sammensætter de tre ansigter i en løbende bevægelse som et hjul. Sådanne kendes ikke i Norden, men det svarer måske til de tre løbende ben. En anden sammensætning, der er godt repræsenteret i vikingetidens kunst specielt på den trefligede fibula, har tre hoveder, hvis halse går ud fra samme centrum, eller omvendt vender håret mod samme centrum.</p>

<p>En kronet figur med tre ansigter, fra et i øvrigt meget interessant astronomisk kalkmaleri i Eskelhem kirke, Gotland, har to fiskehaler som en havmand. Underkroppen er en kæmpestor maske med skæg, og han synes at drikke af en skål. En trehovedet havmand, der holder sig i to fiskehaler, findes også i Baseler Münster, Svejts.</p>

<p>En anden mærkværdig trehovedet figur på Gotland er fremstillet på et kalkmaleri fra Vamlingbo. Den har et en face-ansigt med skæg, og to profiler hver med lang næse og vækster ud af munden. Et lignende tema findes på et træskæreri, Gothem kirke, sammested. Men hvor det sidste har en dyrekrop, deler den første sig i to modstillede dyrekroppe med fælles, omend treansigtet hoved.</p>

<p>Denne version havde jeg ikke truffet på, før jeg nu genfandt en lignende på den udstilling af jugoslavisk kunst, der i øjeblikket afholdes i Paris. Den fandtes som illumination til et middelaldermanuskript, og bar på sit hoved en søjle. Kan dette sammenhæng vidne om Gotlands østeuropæiske forbindelser over Kijef? Det skal jeg ikke kunne udtale mig om. Men det var gensynet med denne figur, der gav mig lyst til at skrive lidt om tidens tre ansigter og deres forekomst i nordisk kunst.</p>

<h2 id="dalmålningar-og-historisk-realisme">Dalmålningar og historisk realisme</h2>

<p>Hvorfor finder man aldrig folkekunsten repræsenteret i de store bøger, som vore kunsthistorikere skriver om den nationale kunst og den internationale kunstudvikling? Selv hos kritikere, der prætenderer at gå ud fra sociale og folkelige interesser. Man siger, at folkekunsten ikke er rigtig kunst. Hverken i sin litterære eller billedmæssige form. Man kalder det folklore, hvad der nærmest er ensbetydende med historiske kuriosa. Men når man ser, hvor lidt de akademiske kredse i dag forstår den enhed, der eksisterer mellem folk og kultur, at kulturen er et resultat af folkets skabende kraft, så forstår man, at det er et privilegium at eje kunst, så forstår man alt, så forstår man, at menneskene ikke kan se det, som de ikke vil se.</p>

<p>At denne blindhed har resulteret i et usandt billede af kulturlivet er én sag, og at denne udvikling har stødt de skabende kunstnere ud i en stadig større parasittilværelse er noget andet, men at denne kunstneriske uafhængighed skulle være en fordel kan næppe være sandt, når kunstneren for at få sociale arbejder, opgaver i samfundets tjeneste, for at kunne arbejde for folket, må lyve, formelt og indholdsmæssigt.</p>

<p>Uden nærmere at analysere folkekunstens kulturelle betydning, og uden at bringe mange historiske og kulturelle data om det her foreliggende materiale om svensk folkekunst søger jeg blot at vise nogle billeder som jeg synes om, billeder, der er skabt af mennesker, som har haft den barnlige glæde at se billeder, at omgås med billeder, og som har skabt en billedverden, som svarer til deres behov.</p>

<p>Det er ikke nogen egentlig anonym kunst, mange af disse kunstneres navne kender man endnu den dag i dag, den er ikke skabt af professionelle kunstnere, men af bønder, som havde denne gave at kunne se billeder, og som vandrede omkring i byerne om vinteren, når de ikke kunne arbejde med deres landbrug, for at lave billeder til de andre bønder. Denne kunst er som den bedste kinesiske kunst gjort af amatører.</p>

<p>Disse svenske vægmalerier er malet på papir, let grundet lærred eller på trævægge med vand- eller oliefarve. Det mest almindelige er vandfarve på lærred. Nogle er gjort til en bestemt plads, andre blev rullet sammen og kun hængt op ved helligdage eller familiehøjtider.</p>

<p>Det svenske folk holder af festligheder, de forstår at feste sammen, at forene en fri og løssluppen livsglæde med en højtidelig, stilfuld og farverig organisation og tradition. Det er kun i vor moderne opløste tid, at festen er blev revet løs fra sin sammenhæng med livets højtider. Og endnu i dag kan man i afsides egne i Sverige finde bønder, som lever, arbejder og fester og fejrer højtider på samme måde, som disse billeder viser, som tror på de samme ting, som de mennesker, der har gjort disse billeder, men for øvrigt er denne folkekultur døende, også i Sverige.</p>

<p>Hvad har disse mennesker troet på? I almindelighed kan man helt enkelt se disse billeder som udtryk for en naivt oprigtig og barnlig religiøsitet. Det er sandt, at disse billeder for det meste er prægede af en bibelsk mytologi, og at de med forkærlighed beskæftiger sig med de ældste jødiske sagn. Men behandlingen af disse emner viser på en ejendommelig måde, hvorledes denne motivverden er smeltet sammen med den tid, det miljø og det folk, som har skabt billederne. De historiske motiver er ikke opfattet historisk, men symbolsk. Abraham, Isak, David, Goliat, Absalon, Salomon o.s.v. er ikke jøder, men svenske bønder fra 17- og 1800tallet. Kunsthistorien regner det for et realistisk fremskridt, når de klassiske kunstnere begyndte at anvende jøderne som model for deres religiøse billeder og Palestina som baggrund for den kristne mytologi. Det kalder man “historisk realisme”. I denne mærkværdige terminologi bliver de svenske billeder urealistiske. Ikke fordi de anvender en fremmed motivkreds, men fordi de ikke er historisk korrekte, som om man kunne fremstille noget andet end sig selv og sin egen tid realistisk og historisk korrekt. Den “historiske realisme” opfatter man i dag som en illusionistisk indlevelse i en tid, som ikke længere eksisterer, og et miljø, som man overhovedet ikke kan vide noget virkeligt om, som man i hvert fald ikke har oplevet.</p>

<p>At den svenske bondebefolkning kunne fremstille de bibelske billeder med så stor en sand realisme, og anvende dem som symbol for deres eget liv beror uden tvivl på, at deres livsorganisations sociale struktur havde store ligheder med israeliternes patriarkalske historie.</p>

<p>De svenske bønders ukomplicerede og rationelle sociale indstilling viser sig tydeligt i gengivelsen af kongen, biskoppen, bonden og bondekonen, hvorover der står: <em>Kongen siger: Jeg regerer over jer alle, og biskoppen siger: Jeg underviser jer alle, og bonden siger: Jeg giver jer alle føden.</em></p>

<p><em>Hjemme sidder bondekonen og siger selv: Jeg klæder jer alle.</em> Det er, som om hun optræder i opposition til de tre store autoriteter, og som om maleren vil vise os sine specielle sympatier for hende. Kvinden har altid haft en meget fri stilling i de skandinaviske lande.</p>

<p>Denne frie tone mellem de to køn kommer også til udtryk i billedet af det unge kærlighedspar, som mødes ved livstræet. Manden hilser kvinden med ordene: “God dag min ven og rose, kan jeg sove hos dig?” Eller i den humoristiske tegning af hanrejen og den kendte foryngelsesmølle, ungdomsmøllen.</p>

<p>Skal man herudover forklare, hvad disse mennesker troede og satte deres lid til, så må man sige, at de for det første havde en stærk tro på sig selv, en tro som viser, at de identificerede sig med såvel gud som konge. Disse autoriteter har også haft deres fulde tillid. Det er ikke let at se, om et billede forestiller guden, kongen eller blot bonden selv. Kronen, som i de fleste andre lande er forbeholdt kongen og dronningen, findes altid på sin oprindelige vis i Sverige som folkelig prydelse ved bryllup. Det var for dette folk, og ved disse billeders tilblivelsestid, at Napoleons general Bernadotte blev konge.</p>

<p>De billeder, som her reproduceres, er alle fra landskabet Dalarne. De er ikke de bedste og heller ikke de mest typiske repræsentanter for disse bondebilleder. Denne gruppe er specielt udvalgt, fordi dens sammenblanding af to stilarter virker forvirrende, den viser slutningen og opløsningen af en kunstnerisk tradition, den nærmer sig en mere tilvant europæisk stil, og er derfor i sit sprog lettere at forstå. Det er lettere at trænge ind i svensk folkemaleri, hvis man går ind her.</p>

<p>Europas folkekunst er i de enkelte lande indtil nu kun blevet behandlet ud fra en rent chauvinistisk indstilling. Hvis man undersøger den ud fra en almenmenneskelig og international opfattelse, da viser hele Europas folkekunst en forunderlig sammenhæng og indre enhed tværs over grænserne og står i en fælles modsætning til de klassiske kunsttraditioner. Forskellen mellem en svensk dalmålning og tjekkisk glasmaleri er mærkværdigt lille, det poetiske indhold knytter dem til de moderne amerikanske negres spirituals. Den katastrofale modsætning mellem orient og occident, som eksisterer i vore såkaldte højere kulturlag, findes slet ikke i folkekunsten. Det er den eneste kunst, om hvilken man i sandhed kan sige, at den er international i stil og indhold, samtidig med, at den har sit klare lokale præg.</p>

<p>Et interessant billedelement er den mærkværdige plante, som dukker op overalt i denne kunst, et træ med fantastiske blomster og arabesker. Det er næppe forkert heri at se det almenmenneskelige symbol, livstræet, som har fået sin moderne parallel i juletræet. En mere elementær ejendommelighed er den billedmæssige kompositionsform. I modsætning til den klassiske kompositionssymmetri, som bygger billedet op i statiske stillinger, i hvad man kan kalde dramatisk kontrapunktik, er disse billeder så at sige skrevne i en dynamisk fremadskridende kompositionsform, præget af en vandrende billedaflæsning, ligesom de folkelige billedserier i vore aviser. Ord og tekst knytter sig til billederne på en malerisk måde, snart over, snart under eller inde i billedet, og de indgår i selve billedets opbygning ligesom de kinesiske bogstaver eller moderne vittighedstegninger. Farven er klar og stærk uden underfundighed som i en barnetegning og med samme rige sikkerhed og undertiden endog raffineret penselføring. Denne værdigt fremadskridende dynamiske billedform uden kontrapunktik og indre dramatisk spænding genfinder man overalt i de gamle kulturer, i de egyptiske vægmalerier, de gammelmesopotamiske, og hos de indianske Inka og Mayafolk. Den er uforenelig med den klassiske europæiske naturalisme. Et typisk bevis på dette er den romerske Trajansøjle, som er et håbløst sammensurium af arme, ben, kroppe og hoveder.</p>

<p>Men ser man bort fra de historiske, de almenteoretiske og formelle interesser, de stilistiske vurderinger, som kan have en principiel betydning i fremtidens formskabende arbejde, hvilke kunstneriske interesser kan netop disse svenske billeder da have for os? Kunsthistorien synes ikke at have fundet nogen interesse i dem. Spørgsmålet er, hvor man finder de kunstneriske værdier. Søger man dem i den højeste formelle bearbejdelse, så må det medgives, at disse billeder kun har ringe værdi. Deres teknik er primitiv og deres teoretiske viden er ringe. Men søger man den kunstneriske værdi i det menneskelige indhold, da bliver spørgsmålet, hvad man finder mest værdifuldt i mennesket. Søger man som surrealisterne det komplekse og konfliktbetonede, det dramatiske indhold, da går man uden interesse forbi dalmålningerne. Bryder man sig derimod om den enkle harmoni, den konfliktløse sensualitet, holder man mere af det end af den hæmmede sensibilitet, så bliver denne kunst noget af det mest interessante i nyere europæisk kunsthistorie. Den er gjort med den enkle overlegenhed, som den civiliserede kunst gerne kalder barnlig. Det er let gjort, “une peinture gratuite”, som et barn kan lave det, som man plejer at sige. Let gjort og lykkeligt oplevet, altså inferiør kunst, og dog, er det nu også sådan?</p>

<p>Er det egentlig ikke formelt set den naturlige billedform at kunne udtrykke sig spontant, er det ikke indholdsmæssigt set den naturlige livsform spontant at kunne anvende sine kræfter i et livsbekræftende arbejde. Er det egentlig ikke naturligt at leve et harmonisk liv og enkelt og harmonisk at kunne udtrykke dette liv i kunsten. Er denne kamp med det maleriske stof, er denne kamp for livet, som vi i dag kalder “at leve”, er den virkelig livet? Det naturlige liv er intet drama. En fødsel er intet drama, ingen kamp. Der skal to modsætninger til, for at der kan blive kamp. En kvinde “kæmper” ikke for at føde sit barn. Hun må arbejde, og det kan gøre ondt, men en “kamp” er det ikke, for intet kæmper mod denne fødsel. Skibet kæmper ikke mod storm og hav, for vinden og vandet kæmper ikke mod det. Det forekommer mig, at denne teori om kampen for livet blot er en gentagelse af den gamle metode i naturen at se det samme, som man oplever i samfundet. Ældre tider så i naturen en spejling af samfundet: Solen - kongen, månen - dronningen, o.s.v. Vi ser i naturen alles kamp mod alle, vort samfunds lov. Er det rigtigt?</p>

<p>Skildrer disse billeder noget aktuelt? For os nutidsmennesker kan de ikke anvendes som en aktuel social realitet, men jeg holder af dem. Det er alt, hvad jeg ved. Jeg holder af deres indhold og deres form. Det er måske romantik, men hvad kan jeg gøre ved det? Når den sociale virkelighed ikke er behagelig, kan jeg naturligvis kæmpe mod den, men med hvilket mål? Da må jeg jo også have en drøm om noget bedre inden i mig. Jeg ønsker ikke at gå tilbage, men når jeg går fremad, så må der findes noget, som jeg kalder fremad, og det er den menneskelige glæde. Var disse mennesker glade? Nej, de var også undertrykte, men ikke i den grad som vi er nu. De drømte også om et paradis, men dette paradis lignede meget et sted, et eller andet sted i Dalarna i Sverige.</p>

<h2 id="gjessings-regel---hyldest-til-en-stor-nordmand">Gjessings regel - hyldest til en stor nordmand</h2>

<p>Da jeg i 1961 opdagede en mængde ristninger på kirkerne i Normandiet, besluttede jeg at lade fotografierne, som Gérard Franceschi havde udført, offentliggøre i en bog. Teksterne håbede jeg at få fra nordiske og franske videnskabsmænd, men de franske vilde ikke have med sagen at gøre. Jeg regner med, at det er, fordi de ikke selv havde lagt mærke til dem. Det forklarer naturligvis ikke det hele, for de vidste næppe rigtigt, hvad de skulle mene om dem.</p>

<p>En glædelig overraskelse var det derfor, at den norske arkæolog og senere etnolog og sociolog, professor Gutorm Gjessing, der er kendt for at have publiceret størsteparten af de norske helleristninger, inden han helligede sig sociologien, gik til opgaven og gennemgik materialet.</p>

<p>Også han måtte, som jeg, blive slået af ligheden med de nordiske bronzealderhelleristninger. Men hvordan er det muligt at forklare, at vi genfinder alle disse billedmotiver på kirkerne i Normandiet to tusinde år efter, at de florerede i Norden? Skålgruber, cirkler med og uden kors, slanger, spiraler, skibe, fugle, fodsålsaftryk, håndaftryk, dansende figurer med den ene hånd hævet og den anden sænket, figurer med enorme hænder, pløjescener, hjorte, køer, heste osv. bortset fra tegn af nyere oprindelse. Skulle det være muligt, at vikingerne i Norden måtte have bevaret denne billedverden lige fra bronzealderen i en nu forsvundet og forgængelig fremstillingsform?</p>

<p>På trods af, at dette kan virke ret fantastisk, er det dog efter Gjessings mening den mest sandsynlige forklaring. Hvordan skal man ellers forklare deres forekomst? Folkemindet er utrolig sejlivet, specielt i Norden. Denne kendsgerning belyser Gjessing med mange eksempler, f.eks. folkesagnet i Bolling, der fortalte, at en vogn med guld var blevet sænket ned i Dejbjerg mose. Da arkæologerne i 1881-83 begyndte deres udgravninger, fandt de ikke blot én, men to Dejbjergvogne fra før-romersk tid. I to tusinde år vidste folk på egnen dette.</p>

<p>Men er en tradition så vedholdende, hvorfor finder vi da ikke de samme tegn i Norden op til nyere tid? Dette var det andet spørgsmål, som Gjessing skulle give en forklaring på, og det er i denne forbindelse, at han fastslår det epokegørende princip, som jeg tillader mig at kalde Gjessings regel. Han konstaterer nemlig, at en metode eller en tradition opfører sig ganske anderledes i det miljø, der har skabt den, end omplantet i et miljø, hvor den ikke er i overensstemmelse med sin oprindelse. Han siger ordret: “Når en tradition er omplantet i et nyt miljø, er den ofte præget af en tendens til at forstene, til at hærdes og lukke sig inde i sig selv i en fuldstændig uforanderlig form.”</p>

<p>Det drejer sig her ikke om en regel, hvis konsekvens er uddraget af det materiale, som jeg har lagt på bordet. Tværtimod. Det er en foræring, som Gjessing med en flot gestus tilkaster mig, en konsekvens af en livslang opofrelse i tjenesten for erkendelsen af det menneskelige, og i tydningen af de spor, som menneskene efterlader sig.</p>

<p>Det ser måske ikke ud af så meget. Reglen er, som så mange af de fundamentale grundregler, der bestemmer vor tænkning, så selvfølgelig, at man synes at enhver kunne have sagt dette, at enhver forsker ved det, men det er Gjessing, der har udformet denne regel.</p>

<p>Jeg skal ærligt indrømme, at heller ikke jeg fandt noget særlig mærkværdigt i Gjessings eksempel, som fremhæver den forbavsende konservatisme, der har bevaret det gamle nordiske sprog på Island og Færøerne. Det var først, da min franske ven Noël Arnaud begyndte at hidse sig op og påpege det generelt brugbare i denne regel, at jeg begyndte at spekulere dybere over sagen. Han henviste til det ejendommelige renæssancefransk, som stadig er gældende hos de franske canadiere. Komisk nok viser de her nævnte eksempler alle hen på en lingvistisk regel, men dens anledning er billedmæssig. Vi har altså her, hvad jeg vil kalde en betegnende eller semantisk regel, fælles for sprog og billeder, uafhængig af begge, bag ved begge disse foreteelser, direkte udtryk for menneskenes være- og handlemåde uafhængigt af, i hvilket system, lingvistisk, billedmæssigt etc. dette giver sig udtryk. Vi har her et grundelement i en generel semantisk morfologi.</p>

<p>På denne måde bliver Gjessings regel, “the missing link” det sensationelle bindeled mellem to studier, der før var uforenelige, sprogstudiet og stilstudiet.</p>

<p>Omplantningen af en tradition i et nyt miljø gælder i tid såvel som i rum. En ny civilisatorisk-teknisk metodik har den samme virkning som en omplantning fra en kulturkreds til en anden, og Gjessings regel gælder i begge forhold. Vi behøver blot at betragte det latinske sprog før og efter reformationen. Før reformationen var det et fællessprog for et vesteuropæisk konkret åndeligt fællesskab. Det blev da radbrækket og omformet, som ethvert levende sprog bliver det. Efter reformationen blev det mere og mere perfektioneret og dødt, men hvad Gjessing påpeger er, at det blev perfektioneret, netop fordi det blev bevaret som en døende eksklusivitet for et isoleret åndsaristokrati, det Grundtvig kaldte den sorte skole. Blot må vi i sandhedens navn gå endnu videre og fastslå, at det samme skete med Grundtvigs tanke, da den blev en isme, et dogme, en symbolsk tænkning.</p>

<p>Det er her, Gjessings regel virkelig griber i dybden af menneskeånden, i beskrivelsen af overgangen fra tegn til symbol. Alt, hvad vi lærer fra andre uden selv at have oplevet det som en menneskelig begivenhed, bliver en symboliseret, forstenet og lukket form. Men hvor mange af disse forstenede former er vi ikke tvunget til at trække af sted med hele livet igennem? Jeg kan jo ikke gå ud og slå et menneske ihjel for at overbevise mig om sandheden af, at jeg ikke må dræbe. Gjessings regel er en lov, som karakteriserer en mængde af, hvad jeg personligt gør og tænker hele tiden og ikke blot jeg, men alle, om de vil indrømme det eller ej. Den bevidste udformning af en sådan regel berettiger efter min mening Gjessing til Nobelprisen. Men se, om han får den.</p>

<p>Hvad er det, der i den grad fascinerer os ved synet af billeder og former fra gamle tider? Hvad får os til at lytte til ældede, fjærne ord og beretninger? Hvad sker der når vi søger kontakt med disse fantasier, fremmede for vore egne drømme, men hvormed vi dog synes at have een eller anden hemmelig kontakt?</p>

<p>I et præludium har digteren Wordsworth sammenlignet vor famlende usikkerhed i forsøget på at skue ind i den forløbne tid med det billede man oplever set fra en båd på en stille sø når man stirrer i vandet, der toner sig i stigende dunkelhed. Man aner en bund i dybet med farver, former og usikre omrids. Spejlingerne fra træer, himlens skyer, ja fra ens eget ansigt blander sig ind i billedet, der nu og da fordrejes af bølgende dønninger for så pludselig for en tid helt at forsvinde i en krusning af overfladen der kommer og går, man ved ikke hvorfra og hvorhen.</p>
