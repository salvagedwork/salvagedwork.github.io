## Preamble

Cumbel is rather poor in *prehistoric* remains and also quite lacking in monuments and documents from the *medieval* era. Sur Antoni Baselgia drew attention to the loss of archival materials through the fires of the rectory in 1682 and 1952, as well as on the occasion of the departure of the Capuchin fathers.<sup>1</sup> Nevertheless, the historical wealth of the last 400 years is considerable. The church books, chronicles and diaries, acts and protocols in the parish and communal, episcopal and cantonal archives illuminate the religious and daily life of the parish and the village, the doings and dealings of its inhabitants, pious and industrious, in a vivid and varied picture.

The books that have been studied, written and printed at Cumbel are yet further testimony to religious cultivation. No less so the vibrant religious cult and venerable cultic and secular customs. From the ranks of this village on the slope have emerged numerous men of fine culture: mistrals (communal magistrates), physicians, scribes and poets and men of state who have given shape to the political and cultural life in Surselva. – The following pages of this work will shed light on this and much more besides.

«Cumbel», the name of the village, appears in the oldest documents in several forms, such as Cumble 825<sup>2</sup>, Cumeltz<sup>3</sup>, 1282 Cumbils, 1345 Cumbels, 1396 Cumels, 1527 Gumeltz, 1572 Gumpels, 1585 Gomel<sup>4</sup>. According to Robert Pianta, the question of the name's derivation must be left open: although it may derive from *cumulus*, in which case «ad cumulos», meaning «at the mounds», or perhaps also from the Gallic «cumba» respectively its diminutive cumbula, in its locative cumbulae, which would mean something like valley, small valley.<sup>5</sup>

From *prehistoric* times there is thus little to report. In one of the four prehistoric pits that have been discovered, only a single Roman shard was found.<sup>6</sup> That amounts to little and yet allows certain, rather uncertain conclusions to be drawn.

## I. From Medieval Times

### 1. On estates and alps, purchases and agreements

An older mention of Cumbel is already found in the imperial register (Reichsurbar) of the year 825, a register that records and inventories the possessions of the empire in Rhaetia. Here a property in Cumbel, a manse (mun), is recorded with the words: «in villa Cumble mansum». At the same time, the same document already mentions a chapel of St. Murezi, which possessed 60 measures of land.<sup>7</sup> The existence of a settlement at Cumbel thus appears to be established already more than eleven centuries ago. But here the curtain falls over Cumbel for a longer time.

Around the middle of the 13th century, the barons de Belmont had acquired larger possessions and rights in the Foppa and in the Lumnezia.<sup>8</sup> Baron Heinrich de Belmont, brother of the bishop of Cuera, Konrad III. de Belmont (1272-1282), had already had an altar erected in the cathedral of Cuera, the altar of St. Conrad. By instrument of 25 September 1282, Baron Heinrich had endowed this altar with one of his properties in Cumbel, called a Camadringes (mit seiner Hube im Dorfe Cumbels die zu Camadringes heisst und im Tal Lungnez liegt), «which yields annually a value of 24 shillings in grain, cheese and cloth». The patronage of the altar he reserved for himself and his descendants. Meanwhile it so happened that his brother, the prince-bishop Conrad III, who was at that time on the journey to or from the provincial council that the archbishop of Mainz had convened, died unexpectedly at Dieburg (c. 10 km east of Darmstadt) on 25 September 1282. Despite the long and arduous journey, the coffin was transported to Cuera and buried before the altar that his brother had made, the altar of St. Conrad. The patronage of this altar later passed to the counts of Sulz-Vaduz and from there to the counts of Liechtenstein.<sup>9</sup> This was the origin of that feudal charge on the property in Cumbel, which continued under the name «the ground rent of Cuera» or «the ground rent to the cathedral.<sup>10</sup>»

The feudal charge on this land lasted nearly 500 years, until 1745. Then it was bought out. The families who enjoyed the properties paid annually 74.– Rhenish ground rent per year to the benefice of St. Conrad, and this partly in money and partly in grain. A measure of grain (pischada) was reckoned at 10 Rizer per Krene, and cheese at 5. The time came when all feudal charges had to fall. In 1744 a contract was drawn up between the landowners in Cumbel on one side and the bishop and the cathedral provost as patron of the benefice on the other side. For Cumbel, the mistral Gion Rest Arpagaus and Gion Arpagaus, who had been 1741 commissary in Chiavenna, were commissioned. As the redemption sum, 30.– Rhenish capital was reckoned for each of the 74 Rhenish ground rents, making 2220.– Rhenish. This amount the delegation from Cumbel paid out at the episcopal castle on 15 January 1745. Besides the two named there was also a third, namely mistral Murezi Arpagaus. The receipt was signed by bishop Jos. Benedict von Rost, the provost Carlo Giuseppe Mengotti and the beneficiary of St. Conrad, Francesco Antonio Mengotti.<sup>10a</sup>

In the year 1371, with the death of Ulrich Walter de Belmont, Adelheid de Belmont, married to Heinrich II de Montalt, had taken over the estate of the de Belmonts.<sup>11</sup> In 1375 she granted as hereditary fief (Erblehen) to a certain Johannes da Vanescha the alp Patnaul in the territory of Vrin.<sup>12</sup> When and how this alp later came into the hands of a family *de Puoz* of Cumbel is not clear. But in the year 1469, Turtè de Puoz, legitimate daughter of Gieri de Puoz and married to a certain Filipp Andrea, had sold the alp Patnaul with the consent of her husband and her guardian, to the citizens of Semione near Malvagia in the Val Blegn, for a price of 74 Rhine guilders (rheinisch Gulden), with the condition of being allowed to drive the cattle through the snow down to the river.<sup>13</sup> A communal assembly (burgameina) some years later, in 1489, states however that the purchase of the alp Patnaul, which the citizens of Semione «had made with various private individuals», had cost only 60 Rhine guilders.<sup>14</sup> It appears that people later regretted having sold this alp to the Ticinesians, because in the year 1577 «Hans de Camuns, former mistral in the Lumnezia and others» brought a charge before the court of the Lumnezia against the citizens of Semione and declared the purchase of Patnaul to be invalid, since the guardian of Turtè de Puoz had sold it without notifying and informing the «oberkeit» (authority) in the Lumnezia. They, the plaintiffs, wished to reconquer the alp for the sale price, in accordance with the right of retraction (dretg da tratga) in force in the Lumnezia. The people of Semione, on the other hand, argued that they had purchased this alp «in perpetuity» and they had enjoyed the alp incontestably for about a hundred years. The court recognized and confirmed the deed of sale of 1469.<sup>15</sup> The opponents, however, took the matter further to the civil court of the Grey League at Trun. Here Raghet de Capol and his advocate Landrechter Sebastian de Castelberg acted in the name of the commune of Semione against Capitani Risch de Camuns. They argued that the court of the Lumnezia had no right to decide in this matter. The other party, «Statthalter Martin, as assistant of Capitani Risch da Camuns and his advocate Johann de Jochberg argued that whenever something was sold out of the community, every citizen had the right to reclaim it for himself». Trun decided that the judgment of the court of the Lumnezia was invalid and that the matter should be decided by the court of the Foppa.<sup>16</sup> That court decided in favor of Risch de Camuns, namely that he had the right to acquire the alp. But then promptly followed, still in October 1578, a definitive judgment from the court of appeal at Trun, under the presidency (cauligia) of Cristian Desax, in favor of Semione, which approved the deed of purchase of 1469.<sup>17</sup>

## II. The Separation from Pleif

### 1. The Capuchin Fathers Arrive

#### a) Why Specifically Cumbel?

The church of Cumbel became relatively quite early free from the principal and valley church of Pleif. That this succeeded so soon and so quickly is without doubt connected with the Rhaetian Mission of the Capuchins and with the introduction of the Capuchin fathers to Cumbel. The Rhaetian Mission of the Capuchins, founded by the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith in 1621 and governed from Roma, had as its aim to maintain and cultivate the Catholic faith and to suppress the progression of the Reformation. For this reason the Capuchin fathers were also placed primarily in «imperiled» locations exposed to the Reformation. Such a post was Cumbel, the first village after Porclas, at the entrance to the upper Lumnezia. In a report to the Congregation of Propaganda on the state of the Rhaetian Mission from the year 1662, the father provincial of Brescia wrote that the third Capuchin post in Surselva (Mustér, Danis), Cumbel, was situated at the borders of the community of the Foppa, with its many Protestant communes, «administered by cunning preachers». Therefore the permanent presence of the Capuchin missionaries in that place was still necessary, «to oppose their perfidy . . .<sup>26</sup>». To this report the Roman congregation noted the following: The post at Cumbel cannot be given up. On the contrary, because of the eight parishes (in the Lumnezia) the location appears to need even more fathers, and this all the more as it lies in the vicinity of heretical communes and preachers.<sup>27</sup> With this report also agrees well what the prefect of the Mission, P. Cristoforo da Tusculano, wrote to Roma in the same year 1662: «Cumbel lies at the borders of the Foppa, where there are many heretics, served by very wicked preachers (serviti da predicanti pessimi). Therefore the Capuchins there have many controversies with them and much to do to confirm the Catholics. Precisely for this reason the bishop formerly placed the fathers there and precisely there a Capuchin station is still necessary.»<sup>28</sup> On 15 August 1662 the father Provincial communicated to Roma: « . . . it would be good to maintain more fathers at Cumbel and at Sevgein and it is above all necessary to secure those two hospices with an annual income, so that the fathers may have something to live on . . .»<sup>29</sup>. From another «raguaglio» (report) of 1681, written by the vice-prefect of the Mission, P. Paul d'Agnesogno, to the holy Congregation in Roma, we learn that Cumbel was a small village with about 250 inhabitants, bordered on three sides by Protestants only one to two hours away.<sup>30</sup> A year later the vice-prefect reports on the work of his two fathers at Cumbel, among other things: «Here the two fathers are stationed to keep heresy at bay, which threatens them from two sides.»<sup>31</sup>

Such testimonies could be adduced in even greater number. These suffice to: 1. illuminate the tension and debate in the confessional relations of the 17th century in general, and 2. to explain why the missionary fathers were placed at Cumbel and not in any other parish of the Lumnezia.


#### b) Father Ireneo da Casalmoro

In the autumn of 1649, Father Ireneo Bartolinelli da Casalmoro arrived at Cumbel. He was one of the most prominent and capable missionaries of the Rhaetian Mission of his time. Since 1623, when he had joined the Mission, he had endured all manner of hardships and miseries. This was especially so in the first years in the Engiadina Bassa, where he was stationed at Zernez and at Ardez, traveling and missionizing throughout the valley in all directions. In 1626 he came to Domat, in 1628 to Rueun, and in 1632 he was appointed prefect of the Mission. Then he worked for some years in the Alvra, at Lantsch and Brinzeuls, and in 1635 at Cazas and again at Casti. Most recently he had been at Sagogn from 1642 to 1649. At Cumbel he remained until 1665, thus 16 years. Old and weary, the venerable missionary returned in 1665 to his monastery at Brescia, to die there on 8 June 1671 at the age of 80 years. As prefect of the Mission he had served from 1632 to 1642. In 1645 the holy Congregation de Propaganda fide transferred the office of prefect of the Rhaetian Mission to the father Provincial of Brescia, with the order to appoint from among the missionaries in Rhaetia itself a vice-prefect and to transfer to him the ordinary competencies of a prefect as heretofore. In that year 1645, P. Ireneo was thus appointed vice-prefect until 1649, and he served again as such from 1651 until 1665, when he left Cumbel.<sup>32</sup> The bishop of Cuera, Johann VI., conferred upon him the dignity and office of a dean of the Sursilvan chapter, and as Bonari reports, the bishop supposedly always wished to be accompanied by him on his confirmation journeys.<sup>33</sup>

P. Ireneo is described as an apostle full of fire and flame. With his fiery rhetoric and his example, during his years of work in the Engiadina Bassa he had re-Catholicized a large part of the inhabitants under unspeakable hardships.<sup>34</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-03.jpg" caption="P. Ireneo encouraged the confreres (from V. Bonari)" %}

In the autumn of 1624, under de Cœuvres, the French troops spread through the Engiadina. The preachers, having been expelled, returned, and the re-Catholicization of the valley that had begun collapsed. The Capuchin fathers were badly persecuted: some had to flee and some were expelled from the valley.<sup>35</sup> But the superior P. Ireneo was a rock for all «and admonished the confreres to perseverance» (illustration). In the years 1635/36 the plague raged at its worst in the Grischun. In a report from Brescia of 1635, on the pestilence in the Grischun, one can read: The lack of bodily aid was nothing greater than that of spiritual aid. Secular clergy were only few still alive. Some had been infected through contact with the sick, others had withdrawn so as not to catch the disease. In this misery the missionary fathers came to help. The prefect P. Ireneo distinguished himself above all, often finding himself in the greatest dangers. On one occasion someone drew a sword over him. On another occasion he received a stone near the stomach, but without suffering the slightest harm. They went through the villages and into the houses visiting the sick of the plague.<sup>36</sup> The chronicler P. Ezechiel da Bagnolo never tires of praising our P. Ireneo: He commanded German and Romansh as well as the natives. He eliminated abuses and raised the debased morals of the people, conducted beautiful divine services that were a delight for the angels. From the persecutions in the Engiadina he had reportedly been in mortal danger several times. He bore everything with cold blood and had stayed with his people.<sup>37</sup> Another manuscript in the state archive of Milaun, which must be regarded as somewhat legendary, reveals: The moral and religious conditions at the arrival of the fathers in the Engiadina were horrendous. The fathers preached on Sundays and feast days three and four times a day, went through snows and cold, often fasting, to nourish the starving souls. They often ate only boiled herbs with a simple tea. To a pamphlet from the Protestant side, P. Ireneo had responded with a counter-publication, which he had however not had printed. He had written a book of doctrine, which he had had printed in Brescia.<sup>38</sup> – Among the numerous converts whom he led to the Catholic faith is found as one of the most prominent the preacher Simon Pianta.<sup>39</sup> On 18 June 1638, the latter had solemnly renounced in the parish church of Casti the Reformed confession and solemnly professed the Catholic one. P. Ireneo received his confession in the presence of the father Provincial, who happened to be in Casti, and of six further Capuchins.<sup>40</sup> Because of his numerous conversions that he had initiated, he was often called: The bulwark of the faith and the hammer of the heretics (il baluardo della fede ed il martello de gli Eretici). – A man of such caliber, of such influence and importance thus arrived one day in the autumn of 1649 at Cumbel, as a rule, accompanied by a confrere. He was already somewhat advanced in years at 59. The two fathers took lodging in a private house, bequeathed to the Mission or to the rectory.<sup>41</sup> Those 16 years at Cumbel may have been somewhat more restful than the storms of earlier, and yet full of work and effort. When he reportedly left Cumbel in 1665, the people wept; only the preachers rejoiced at being finally freed from the hammer . . .<sup>42</sup>


### 2. The New Parish

It was now at this fair beginning to be expected that Cumbel would not remain merely a fraction of Pleif any longer. How far the preparations had advanced and how great the expectations of the people of Cumbel were at the arrival of the fathers, no documents reveal to us. Probably the separation from Pleif had already been foreseen and concluded at the very beginning between P. Ireneo and the bishop. This is all the more easily conceivable if one considers the great sympathy that the father enjoyed at the episcopal castle. By document of 28 March 1653, prince-bishop Johann VI. Flugi d'Aspermont decreed the separation of Cumbel from the valley church of Pleif. The dismemberment is argued on the grounds of the long distance, the bad roads, especially for the transport of coffins. Old and infirm people would be left without divine service on feast days and Sundays, many would die without the sacraments, and the youth would remain without religious instruction. In the document of separation it is also expressed that the diocesan bishops have, according to the Council of Trent, the authority to found new parishes or to separate a church from the principal one when pastoral need, due to great distance or difficult access to the parish church, demands it, as is the case at Cumbel, indeed even when the pastor of the principal church does not agree. For the further sustenance of the new pastor at Cumbel, all revenues from existing properties and bequests and tithes that had hitherto gone to Pleif are to be applied. Thus the tithe and the bequests from the territory of Cumbel remain at Cumbel. The thorn of the discord that follows! The compensation sum for Pleif is 300.– florins. This sum may be paid in installments, annually 7½ ducats or 15.– florins. Also the contributions to the sacristan (caluster) of Pleif now fall in favor of that of Cumbel. The parish of Cumbel, however, has the obligation to procure the most necessary sustenance for the pastor and the church.<sup>43</sup>

With this the parish of Cumbel was now erected legally and formally; but the old plant uprooted from the valley parish had lost a strong and healthy branch.

### 3. The Justification

In the old parish of St. Vintschegn there now arose a terrible uproar. It directed itself with vehemence against the separation of Cumbel in general and in particular against the alienation of the tithe and the bequests (ulezis). Certain finer specialists even called into question whether such a separation was, from the standpoint of ecclesiastical law, even at all permissible and valid. The tithe that Cumbel gave to the parish church of Pleif had not even been founded by people of Cumbel, but rather by the counts of Sax-Mesauc. Thus Hans da Marmels da Vella<sup>44</sup> attests in the presence of pastor Jochberg that about a year earlier he had deposited in the house of treasury master (sechelmeister) Crest Jori Caduff at Cumbel a parchment in which it was written clearly and expressly that the counts de Sax had founded the tithe at Cumbel for the rectory of Pleif. For this claim Hans de Marmels had also given a written attestation.<sup>45</sup>

Against such a movement the episcopal curia of Cuera now had to defend itself. In the first instance it was a matter for it of asserting the juridical competence and the canonical legality.

In the cathedral provost Cristoph Mohr the curia possessed a versatile jurist and canonist, one who feared no adversary and was always most astute. Mohr was above all a man of politics and an incarnate partisan of the French party. Around 1665 he had resigned the provostship in favor of his brother sur Conradin Mohr and had gone to France in the service of the politics of King Louis XIV and the French party in Rhaetia.<sup>46</sup>

In a long and extensive juridical-ecclesiastical treatise, provost Mohr demonstrated clearly that bishop Johannes Flugi had had the right to carry out this separation.<sup>47</sup> At the outset he proves eclatantly the right of the diocesan bishop to elevate a chapel to a parish church. Among his authorities he cites also the renowned canonist of that time, Johannes Azor.<sup>48</sup> Regarding the second point, namely to dismember the people of Cumbel from the principal church, the diocesan bishop had the full right, and this «de iure ordinario» according to the dispositions of Pope Alexander III, which he cites exactly, and also «de iure delegato» as mandatory of the apostolic see. According to the decree of the Council of Trent, session 21, chapter 4, a diocesan bishop had the right to execute a dismemberment, even without consulting the cathedral chapter, even to dismember from a collegiate church. At Pleif, however, there existed no college, only a pastor. For his evidence Mohr cites, besides several scarcely known authors, also the celebrated Abbas<sup>49</sup>, the renowned Nicolaus Garcias<sup>50</sup> and P. Paul Laymann<sup>51</sup>.

Provost Mohr establishes that there is not even any doubt that the bishop had proceeded legally and reasonably, all in order. The necessary distance from Pleif was given. Often the pastor of Pleif was unable to attend to the sick at Cumbel. As far as was known, 58 persons at Cumbel had died without the sacraments. The youth did not go to Pleif for religious instruction, remained religiously ignorant, and fell into the snares of superstition and sorcery. The population of the remaining parish, with its approximately 1600 inhabitants, was even after the dismemberment of Cumbel large enough.<sup>52</sup>

In a third chapter, provost Mohr addresses the question of the tithe. The tithe from the lands in the district of Cumbel that had gone to Pleif, the bishop had with full right and according to the prescriptions of the Council of Trent been able to assign to the new parish. The rectory of Pleif still retained an annual income of 600.– florins, a revenue that was amply sufficient for the sustenance of the pastor and chaplain, while the tithe at Cumbel yielded no more than 100.– florins. And the «ius patronatus» at Pleif was in any case the right of the counts of Belmont, passed to those de Sax, and from them bishop Ortlieb de Brandis had purchased this right in 1483 for the bishopric.<sup>53</sup>

There remains the reproach that the commune of Vella had not been consulted. This our defender dismisses by saying that the commune of Vella did not in any case have the «ius patronatus» and did not represent the parish either, being rather only one member of it. Moreover, the bishop had made known his intention to those of Vella often enough, and they had merely sneered at it. And in the end, pastor Jochberg had entrusted the matter to the bishop's good management and thereby given his consent. This results clearly from a letter of his of 4 September 1653. Now, however, it is the consent of the pastor *before* and not his resistance *after* the dismemberment that is decisive for the validity of the separation. With what precision canon Mohr hits the mark, concluding his arguments with the words: «Consent once given cannot become invalid through the quarrel that follows. The pastor consented, the ius patronatus belongs to the diocesan head, and finally I say: The bishop with his dismemberment acted materially and formally rightly and pastorally prudently, and thus this separation is to be upheld and defended against anyone, reserving, if need be, the censures of the Roman Church.»<sup>54</sup>

### 4. The Resistance

In the parish of St. Vintschegn the resistance, however, grew ever greater. At the forefront stood the two churchwardens (ugaus) of Pleif, two men of weight, of the first rank in the politics of the time in the Lumnezia: Landrechter Ulrich de Collenberg da Morissen<sup>55</sup> and Capitani Melchior de Mont da Vella<sup>56</sup>. With a so-called «Memorial» in the style of the time, they endeavor to assert the reasons against the separation of Cumbel: It diminished the revenues of the mother church. The tithes and bequests had been founded in their time «by noble lords», by «signori principali» – meaning the feudal lords – in favor of the pastor of Pleif and not by others and in other places; otherwise one would falsify the meaning of the foundation. Secondly, Cumbel had far fewer reasons to separate than other, more distant communes. And thirdly, those would follow the example of Cumbel and the church of St. Vintschegn would ultimately be entirely isolated and impoverished. The future holders of the benefice at Pleif would in no way permit such a separation. From this nothing would arise but troubles and quarrels in the old parish. Also for the dead, the customary suffrages would be lost. The confraternity of the Holy Rosary would come to nothing. The revenues of the chaplaincy and the sacristan would cease, likewise also those of the alms (spenda) and other funds, founded by «noble lords» and not by those of Cumbel. Not without force sounds the fifth point of the arguments: The parish church as head and body should not suffer and be deprived of what is hers on account of a single member among so many members, villages and chapels, which members are likewise subject to the parish church, and the public good comes before private interest, and in particular given the old ancient chapel of Morissen (here one recognizes the claw of the «lion of Morissen», Landrechter Collenberg), which has its tabernacle with the Blessed Sacrament and would already for that reason have more grounds to separate, although it does not do so. That Surcuolm had recently separated was a different case in view of the great distance.<sup>57</sup> Moreover, inhabitants of Cumbel had not founded the tithes and properties of Pleif in the district of Cumbel, and whoever has not sown should also not reap. Those of Cumbel ought to content themselves with the benefice of St. Conrad<sup>58</sup> which they pay to the cathedral of Cuera, to fill up their church benefice and not despoil their mother church. As a conclusion to their «Memorial», the authors procured a document signed and sealed by the clerical chapter and by the court of the Lumnezia, with the declaration that in the event the Capuchin fathers were to be installed at Cumbel, this should occur without disadvantage to the revenues of Pleif.<sup>59</sup>

On 26 July 1654, the entire parish assembled in the parish church at Pleif to adopt a communal resolution of protest. The Italian text reads, in a version as literally as possible, in Romansh:

«We, the mistral, the council, the churchwardens and patrons together with the entire parish of Pleif in the Lumnezia declare and attest by the present document, to each and every one, ecclesiastic as well as secular, of whatever estate, condition and dignity he may be, that on this day, after mature consideration of all necessary circumstances and foundations, as also of the judgment given by the most illustrious and most reverend lord bishop of Cuera, for the conceded and ordered separation of the church of Cumbel from our old mother church of Pleif, to our prejudice and in our absence and contumacy, through which dismemberment the better revenue that was formerly paid and was also to be paid by the people of Cumbel, by their forebears and predecessors without any opposition or contradiction, and that should in the future serve the separated church of Cumbel: On this we renew and affirm the resolution and deliberation already previously taken and made, and we deliberate anew with unanimous consent, that in case there are no means and measures to quiet the opposing party and that it will not desist from its wicked and unreasonable intent, then we declare anew that we do not wish, in any manner and at no time, to admit or concede such an unheard-of and never-before-claimed novelty, to the damage and diminution of our Catholic religion and of the valid reasons bequeathed to us by our predecessors as a singular example and instruction; but as true Catholics following the example of our forebears, we have resolved upon the defense and conservation of the acquired liberty, of the prerogatives and of our religion, and to commit thereto all our knowledge and power, our life and honor. — And therefore, in case anyone should wish to molest or prejudice us in the said matters, in our privileges and our liberties, we protest by virtue of the present in all better and valid form that may be made, against all expenses, all damages and all misfortunes and against all shedding of blood, and of having absolutely no fault in all this and at no time, but rather of rightly attributing the fault to the authors and adversaries. – In faith and confirmation of all that is contained in the present, the most illustrious lord Benedetg de Mont, currently mistral, has by our commission and in the name of all of us sealed and corroborated the present with the seal of our community at Vella, the place of our ordinary residence, on 26 July 1654.»<sup>60</sup>

To achieve something more, the representatives of Pleif sought aid from the papal nuncio who resided then in Lucerna. But also the young parish of Cumbel had not been idle and had taken refuge with the nunciature, complaining that Pleif refused to recognize the dismemberment made by the bishop.<sup>61</sup> Sur de Jochberg did not wish to come out to S. Murezi for the feast. He then received permission from Lucerna to celebrate that «indulgence» (perdanonza), since that chapel belonged to the entire Lumnezia.<sup>62</sup> Nuncio Federigo Borromeo<sup>63</sup> had representatives of both parties summoned to him to mediate and pacify the dissidents<sup>64</sup>.

After having heard both parties, the nuncio ordered:

1. The dismemberment of Cumbel remains in force and the decree of the bishop is approved word for word, except: The tithe of Cumbel goes to Pleif as long as sur Cristian Jochberg holds the office of pastor there, because also the citizens of Cumbel had participated in his election for life. For his reduction of workload, sur Jochberg pays to the new pastor of Cumbel annually 7½ ducats, respectively 15.– florins.

2. After the death of sur Jochberg (as well as after his possible resignation), the tithe from the properties in the district of Cumbel goes in favor of the pastor of Cumbel, and he pays annually to the pastor of Pleif 7½ ducats, respectively 15.– florins.<sup>65</sup>

Shortly afterwards the nuncio additionally obligated the father at Cumbel to go with his parishioners to Pleif on the great feasts, so as to maintain somewhat the relations with the old parish. Which feasts is not specified in the document.<sup>66</sup>

With the execution of the last clause things did not go well. The churchwardens of Pleif complained to the nuncio and to the bishop that the father of Cumbel did not come to the feasts, even though the pastor had disbursed his 15 fl.–, but in the future he too would not do so if the conditions on the other side were not kept. But also the father Provincial of Brescia stood entirely with father Ireneo.<sup>67</sup> Then the churchwardens of Pleif turned further with a letter to the abbot of Mustér, Adalbert II., to supplicate him to intercede on their behalf with the nuncio.<sup>68</sup> Nuncio Borromeo replied to those of Pleif in a conciliatory tone and promised to persuade father Ireneo to attend as far as possible the feasts at Pleif, and they should not desist on their part.<sup>69</sup>


### 5. The Consolidation

With the death of sur dean Cristian Jochberg at Pleif in 1666<sup>70</sup>, everything should have proceeded in order according to the Borromean judgment of September/October 1655 and according to the dismemberment document of the bishop. The tithe at Cumbel should have remained at Cumbel in favor of the new pastor. But in the old parish the resistance still persisted, grown to the highest degree. Indeed, threats were made to come for the tithe by force of arms if necessary.<sup>71</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-06.jpg" caption="Altars before the restoration of 1942 - View of the choir before the restoration of 1955/57, dating from the restoration of 1905/07" %}

In view of such obstructions, the parish of Cumbel took refuge with the new papal nuncio in Lucerna, Ubaldo Baldeschi.<sup>72</sup> He promptly threatened, or had the episcopal curia threaten, excommunication upon all the recalcitrants, namely upon the churchwardens of Pleif, Landrechter Ulrich de Collenberg and Melchior de Mont, and upon the new pastor of Pleif, sur Gieli de Mont-Löwenberg<sup>73</sup>, the suspension of his office. The churchwardens of Cumbel turned in turn to the bishop and the nuncio with the supplication to help them in the execution of the decrees.<sup>74</sup>

A delegation from Pleif had meanwhile been to Lucerna to see the nuncio. He then summoned both parties to him.<sup>75</sup> Nuncio Baldeschi resolutely defended the cause of Cumbel, confirmed anew the dismemberment and declared in force the judgment of nuncio Borromeo of autumn 1655<sup>76</sup> and supplicated the new bishop of Cuera, Duri de Mont da Vella, not to give in at all to the unjust claims of Pleif, since the decrees of bishop Flugi and of nuncio Borromeo were in force<sup>77</sup>. To finally bring an end to the quarrels, already about 15 years old, the new papal nuncio, Acquaviva<sup>78</sup>, charged the cathedral dean of Cuera, Dr. Mattias Sgier<sup>79</sup>, to take the matter in hand. Canon Sgier was a man of caliber and great importance. With the commission of the nunciature, the dean traveled to the Lumnezia – it was the autumn of 1668 –, thoroughly informed himself on location about the situation in all its details, summoned the parties, mediated and interceded.<sup>80</sup> To the diplomacy of a canon Sgier it also succeeded to broker the peace. By a letter of 6 April 1669, «the mistral, council and people of the parish of St. Vintschegn» thank the nuncio Acquaviva and supplicate him to confirm the agreement obtained through dean Sgier.<sup>81</sup> About the content of the agreement we are deplorably not directly informed. But as one can see from later acts, Cumbel continued to pay a certain share of the tithe to Pleif for a long time yet. More on this in a further chapter below.

Sur Cristian Arpagaus da Cumbel, pastor at Lumbrein<sup>82</sup>, who had apparently supported Cumbel in the last battles, wrote to the curia and said that the people of Cumbel were glad and grateful to the bishop for his support and happy about the new parish. But the attacks against it had brought no good fortune, neither to sur Jochberg nor to the churchwardens Landrechter Collenberg and Capitani de Mont. «If God is with us, who is then against us.» The adversaries of the separation would even today be glad if P. Ireneo were to leave Cumbel, which the bishop may well want to prevent.<sup>83</sup>


## III. Of the Rectory Benefice

### 1. Real Estate

As in other places, our rectory benefice was also established by generous donors and gradually augmented by benefactors.<sup>84</sup> The documents burned in 1682 could have told us a thing or two. For the year 1777, the following rectory lands are enumerated:

| | |
|---|---|
| 1. Caplauna, tschaveras (measures of land) | 1½ |
| 2. Sur vitg, tschaveras | 1½ |
| 3. Tscharnal, toward Morissen, tschaveras: | ¾ |
| 4. En Quadras, tschaveras: | ½ |
| 5. Sezlinas, tschaveras | ½ |
| 6. On Vala, tschaveras | ½ |
| 7. Curtgin, tschaveras | ¾ |
| **In total, tschaveras** | **6** |
| 8. Summaspezia at S. Murezi, lean meadow  
An alp right in Seglias and an alp right in Selva in Val S. Pieder.<sup>85</sup> |  |


Just shortly before, the rectory had possessed 4 alp rights at «Radons» (= Radun, Duin), which were sold on 10 March 1776 for 74.– florins to Gion Antoni Arpagaus «Schlozzer».<sup>86</sup>

Another inventory of the rectory lands from the year 1858 presents the same lands and names as the above list of 1777, with the exception that the meadow on Vala at that time measured a full tschavera. The property «Curtgin» it locates as «below the Vieli house». Summaspezia is here indicated as a field (acla) with 4 tschuncheismas (fifths) of hay. In addition there now comes the property Bugneida, which yields two tschuncheismas of hay. Furthermore the rectory still has two plots (orts) and a small garden. All these properties yield an annual rent of 127 florins and 50 Kreuzer. Of alp rights there is here no longer any mention.<sup>87</sup>

On 11 April 1872 the parish sold, with the consent of the Ordinariate and of the prefect of the Rhaetian Mission, a good portion of the rectory properties, namely:

1. Summaspezia, for fr. 1420.– to mistral Francestg Arpagaus.

2. Cuolm Bugneida for fr. 1460.– to Gion Murezi Arpagaus da Mattias.

3. Tscharnal upper part, for fr. 522.– to sexton (scarvon) Stefan Arpagaus.

4. Quader grond above the church for fr. 798.– to Francestg Murezi Pign Arpagaus.

5. Quader lower part for fr. 218.– to sexton Luzi Elvedi.

6. La Cuetta outer part for fr. 214.– to sexton Luzi Elvedi.

7. Capleuna, without the stream-bed (rieven), for fr. 1077.– to Martin Cavegn.

8. Plutiala, for fr. 400.– to Gion Murezi Arpagaus da Frena.

9. On Vallà, for fr. 709.– to Gion Bistgaun Collenberg.

10. Curtgin dil pader, for fr. 967.– to Luis Elvedi.

11. Stable and barn of the hospice (rectory house) for fr. 661.– to sexton Luzi Elvedi.

Below the list stands the remark that these properties were sold with the condition that should the Mission, in agreement with the Ordinariate, wish to have them back, the owners would be obligated to return them at the same price.<sup>88</sup> Another list of the same sale also cites as no. 12 an alp right, purchased for fr. 160.– by Gion Giusep Arpagaus. The total sum from this fund amounts to 8609.– fr., which yielded a rent of 430.– fr.<sup>89</sup>

According to a calculation by Father Nicolaus from the year 1880, the rectory properties, after deducting the charge of 38 endowed masses, yield 365.– fr. With the rent from the redeemed tithe of fr. 200.– and with the «grain of the sacristanship» (graun dalla calustria) of 38 fr. and with the enjoyment «of a plot», he arrives at an effective income from the «true prebend» of a total of fr. 677.–.<sup>90</sup>

*The grain of the sacristanship* (il graun dalla calustria) derives from the time when people still went to Pleif for mass. Then the sacristan (caluster) had to see to it that the road was open and passable, especially in winter. In return he received one curtauna (measure) of grain per family, from the less well-off only half. After the separation, this grain went in favor of the pastor. On All Saints' Day (Numnasontga) he had to proclaim that the churchwardens would come the next day for the grain. On All Souls' Day the two churchwardens then went to collect the grain of the sacristanship, and the father gave them a good meal (merenda).<sup>91</sup>

A «status facultatis» of 1897 declares a net worth of the rectory fund of 18 689.– fr.<sup>92</sup>


### 2. The Rectory as a Lending Institution

The rectory funds and also those of the alms (spendas) also fulfilled a certain social and economic role. Founded by donors and augmented over time by benefactors, they often commanded considerable capital, which was lent to private individuals. This practice was then welcome and useful, when there were still far and wide no banking institutions.<sup>93</sup> To illustrate this fact, we can hardly do otherwise than present just a few examples from various periods from the quite voluminous books of accounts, loans and mortgages.

In the year 1737 the total sum of the rectory capital amounted to 1044.– fl.<sup>93a</sup> That year the following were debtors of the rectory – remarkably, almost all from outside Cumbel.

- Gion Bistgaun da Peiden fl. 55.–

- Luregn Basli da Camuns fl. 44.–

- Andriu Balzer Thomas da Silgin fl. 11.–

- Crest dil Fravi and meister Peder da Degen fl. 25.–

- Flurin Peder Bundi fl. 9.–

- Johannes da Bucarischuna fl. 10.–

- Gion Tschegn da Morissen fl. 1.7

- Onna Gudegn fl. 15.–

- Heirs of Gion Peder da Vignogn fl. 10.–

- Thomas Collenberg fl. 20.–

- Weibel Gion Antoni Caduff fl. 68.–

- Gada Caduff fl. 45.–

- Gieri Cabalzar da Degen fl. 30.–

- Crest Candriat da Pitasch fl. 24.–

- Andreas Caduff fl. 103.–

- Gion Anz Casanova fl. 9.–

- Signur sar Tonau fl. 30.–

- Gion Giusep Cavegn fl. 49.–

- Sechelmeister Giacum Vieli fl. 27.–

- Anz Conrad da Surcuolm fl. 60.–

Further debtors, or also creditors, are: Wolf Capaul da Morissen, Josef da Vignogn, Weibel Gios da Glion, the blacksmith (fravi) of Degen, Gion Antoni Collenberg, sechelmeister Martin da Sevgein, Gion Maria Josef Schuoler, Crest Hercli Arpagaus, Otto Demont, Gion Hercli Casanova, sechelmeister Hasper da Valendau, the dyer (ferber) of Peiden, Urschla Collenberg, Crest Murezi Caduff, Sievi Arpagaus, Onna Arpagaus, Gieri Derungs da Vella, Giachen Caduff da Morissen, Martin Blumenthal da Vella, meister Andriu Caduff da Peiden, Urschla Gion Sievi da Peiden, Giachen Gion Thomas Collenberg, Hercli Derungs da Sevgein, Balzer Vieli.<sup>94</sup>

According to a register of 1811, the following had borrowed money from the rectory:

- Gion Antoni Blumenthal da Morissen fl. 45.–

- Crest Caspar Cajo da Rumein fl. 63.–

- Gieli Cadet da Pitasch fl. 60.–

- Stefan Vieli da Cumbel fl. 80.–

- Gion Giusep Cavegn da Surcuolm fl. 160.–

- Gion Antoni Blumenthal with his sister fl. 76.–

- Crest Giusep Collenberg da Cumbel fl. 234.–

- Raget Collenberg da Cumbel 20.–

- Murezi Antoni Arpagaus fl. 93.–

- Gion Giachen Collenberg-Blumenthal da Morissen 84.–

- Gieri Arpagaus da Cumbel fl. 80.–

- Giachen Antoni Blumenthal da Vella 103.–

- Crest Thomas Collenberg da Cumbel fl. 60.–

- Crest Murezi Arpagaus da Cumbel fl. 50.–

- Gion Simon Arpagaus da Cumbel fl. 100.– <sup>95</sup>

The book 1.3 of the communal archive of Cumbel contains the accounts of loans to private individuals in great number. The debtors «of the church of St. Stiafen» are for the most part from other communes: Vella, Morissen, Peiden, Camuns, Surcasti, Tersnaus and Val S. Pieder etc. For the year 1851 there exists a list of 16 private individuals who owe annually to the parish church a half, one or more Krene of grain and who have mortgaged those obligations with plots of meadow and in one case even with a house.<sup>96</sup>

In the year 1859 the rectory lends money to 12 various citizens of Cumbel at 5% interest, secured by plots: 5 manse fields of the hill of Larmens (Larmas?), plots at Pleuncas, Quadras sut, Campials, Sut Vitg, Sax, Buglieuls, Lavadinas, Valà stretg, Val Stuorns (Morissen) and at Frusas.<sup>97</sup> – Even the commune becomes a debtor «of the capital of 144 francs and 50 centimes, which capital derives fr. 68.– for a perpetual mass that the commune has instituted for the citizens of Cumbel who died in the war of the Punt in 1799. Additionally 76.50 fr. for goods given by the fathers to the commune.»<sup>98</sup>

Whoever borrowed money from the rectory had to produce a letter of loan and pledge, generally called «underfan» (= Unterpfand, collateral), as for example:

«1774, 27 March. The lords churchwardens of the rectory, that is Augustin Vieli and Gieri Antoni Arpagaus, have given the capital of fl. 30.– that is thirty at 5 percent to Crest Mattias Castelberg da Peiden, who puts as collateral (underfan) his land called Suadeig (= Suadetg), free and unencumbered. The boundaries are the road, Martin Balzer Arpagaus and Giusep Antoni of blessed memory (d[a] b[eada] m[emoria]) Bundi.»<sup>99</sup>

Another example:

«1780, 9 January, in the presence of the lord churchwarden of the church Gieri Antoni Arpagaus, there was lent to Caspar Gieri Collenberg da Cumbel money from the rectory, 66 Rhine guilders and 32 Rizer, for which an annual interest of five percent is to be paid; he puts as collateral a plot of meadow in La Fravia as in the register. The next interest falls due on St. Paul's (25 January 1781), that is 3 Rhine guilders and 18 Rizer.» <sup>100</sup>

The interest payment dates were almost always the conversion of St. Paul (25 January), St. Martin (11 November) and St. Andrew (30 November).<sup>101</sup> The interest rates remained with admirable stability almost always in the 18th and 19th centuries at 5%. One paid one's debts in money, but also in goods, as is noted for example for 1758:

«1758, 8 October. The undersigned Luregn Basli da Camuns has given household grain (pischada da casa), 5 Krene less almost a quarter, making 1 fl. and 3½ Rizer. Additionally one small cheese from the alp (megnucca d'alp), 11¼ Krene, making fl. 1.2. Additionally on 27 September 1759, received from the same one small cheese with a piece of alp cheese (tschagrun d'alp), 20.72 Krene, making fl. 2.3. Additionally on 10 October 1759, received from the same household grain, 9 Krene, making fl. 2.3. Additionally on 8 August 1760, received one Krene of fresh cheese (tschagruncaura), making 2 Rizer . . .»<sup>102</sup>

One paid as one could, also with animals: hens, turkeys (salvanoris), goats and sheep, also with cattle or with meat. One gave «una moggia» (= mugia, a cow), another gave a young bull for fl. 6.–. A third paid his annual interest with veal for such and such florins. A certain one cut wood for a creditor and another gave lime, while a debtor gave «una gallina» (a hen) and another time «un s.h. porco» (a pig) for 8 florins.<sup>103</sup> After 1860 the loans from the rectory began to become more and more rare and ceased around 1880 altogether.


### 3. The Tithe

The tithe was given only in grain: household grain (dumiec), rye (segai) and oats (salin). Of anything else there is no mention. This charge, however, applied only to certain lands in the territory of Cumbel. The properties that were subject to the tithe payable to the rectories of Cumbel and of Pleif are, according to a register, drawn up and officially corroborated at Vella on 8 September 1736, in the presence of the churchwardens (of Cumbel: mistral Gion Arpagaus and sechelmeister Murezi da Caduff), the same as those that appear on the register of 1816.<sup>104</sup> We follow the latter, noting where it varies from the former. The following are the properties:

1. One tschavera of meadow at S. Murezi, with the boundaries . . . with another plot at S. Murezi, with the boundaries . . .

2. Sumblein, on all sides, bordering against the pasture etc.

17. Plaun Fravgia, down toward the main road, toward the Val Mulin, up toward the meadow of the Fontauna and further out toward the road to Morissen.

18. The land above the commune, outward toward the Val Tscharnal.

21. All the land between the ditch (dutg) of Dugigliel and the Val Mulin below Via lada, down toward the Bual da Peiden toward il Crest Marseingia (= Masengia?) and toward Plaunca Gargieri.

22. What is within that plot called Val is subject to the tithe and borders against the ditch of Dugigliel . . . down Frusas . . .

23. The 4th tschavera there at Frusas . . . toward Bosh Grond Quadras . . .

24. One tschavera of field down at Pardiala . . . toward the Carera.

25. The land above the main road, from the Val da Mulin to the ditch of Cuschnaus, all subject to the tithe except half a tschavera.

26. In Quadras Sura there are two tschaveras free from the tithe (1736: Quadra Cuerta).

27. Cuschnaus is all subject to the tithe, excepting one tschavera before Porta Vedra. – «These last twelve parcels are in the territory of Vella and must give the tithe like the others.»

28. Crestas da Chischials . . . toward Pignius.

29. Pignius (1736: Pinyus), which is above Cuschnaus . . . outward toward Vischaillas (1736: Pleunca sper Val).

30. Perdatsch, subject to the tithe is only one tschavera.

31. Cresta Colarina, by the ditch, subject to the tithe are two tschaveras.

32. At Sendas the alms fund (spenda) of Pleif has a plot.

33. Ora Pleuns (1736: Erplauns), one parcel subject to the tithe . . .

34. There at Orplauns, one parcel subject to the tithe (absent in 1736).

35. Valetta (only 1736).

«At Degen, the ordinary seat and residence of the praiseworthy authority (Oberkeit) of the Lumnezia, 1816, 22 February. Jos. Derungs, mistral.»<sup>105</sup>

In autumn the tithe was collected and measured each year. According to the last regulation of 1754, of nine parts five went to the father of Cumbel, three to the pastor of Pleif and one to the so-called «parts». These were certain private individuals who had certain rights therein. On 2 July 1847, the commune bought out those rights «of the parts» in favor of the rectory for the price of 388 fl.– respectively 649.60 francs.<sup>106</sup> Now two thirds went to the rectory of Cumbel, respectively to the father, and one third to Pleif.

To collect the tithe, in early November six men would set out: the two churchwardens and a sworn assessor (gerau) of Cumbel, two from Pleif and one for «the parts». A seventh man went with a cart. In two days the collection was done. Or else they went in nine men, 5 from Cumbel, 3 from Pleif and one for the «parts». Then the work was done in one day. Each of the men received one curtauna of household grain, the one with the cart received two in return. They received at the rectory house twice a day a meal with bread and cheese and wine from the commune. But the father was then still obligated to give the two churchwardens with the assessor a dinner (tscheina).<sup>107</sup> But what a feudal dinner! The father fortunately made a list of the courses that were to be served, all or at least in part, at the father's discretion:

1. Soup, salami or ham.

2. Beef (carri bov) with potatoes (truffels).

3. Risotto with cheese (fortem).

4. Meatballs (puolpettas) or cutlets with dried apples.

5. Veal head (if available) with sauerkraut.

6. Quinces (cutgnas) or stew (buglia) with dried cherries.

7. Roast with turnips (rieblas) and endive salad (salata da randas).

8. A dish of macaroni or homemade tagliatelle (taglierins da casa).

9. «Una tartara a bagno Maria.»

10. A polenta in the form of a cake.

11. Bread with wine, cheese, figs, apples and coffee with brandy (vinars).<sup>108</sup>

In the year 1876 the government of the Grischun ordered that all tithes must be redeemed within three years. Accordingly the rectory had the lands subject to tithe surveyed to calculate the price.<sup>109</sup> On 26 October 1879 the calculation of the tithe was completed. It yielded in household grain 289 curtaunas, rye 51 and oats 13 curtaunas. The household grain was reckoned at 1 fr. per curtauna, the rye at 1.50 and the oats at 2 fr. per curtauna. The total sum of the tithe thus amounted to 391.– fr. and a capital of 7820.– fr. For Cumbel there thus remained 260.66 and for Pleif 133.33 fr.<sup>110</sup> The 260.66 fr. were later reduced to a round 200.– fr.<sup>111</sup> The contribution to Pleif was, as P. Nicolaus remarks, always considered by Cumbel to be unjust and was never welcome.<sup>112</sup>

1878 was the last tithe. After its dissolution, the dinner for the churchwardens should also have been discontinued, as the father prefect had in any case also declared. But quite mistaken, notes the pastor, P. Nicolaus, in his «Memorias per mes successurs» (Memoirs for my successors) in the year 1879: «One day the president (suprastont), mistral Gion Gieri Arpagaus, appears and pleads with warm words to continue giving the dinner to the gentlemen, to maintain the bond of friendship . . . I wrote to the father prefect and he left it to my discretion . . . and so I resolved to continue giving the dinner, not out of obligation, but out of friendship.»<sup>113</sup> And the dinner continued, served each year sometime during the carnival season (tscheiver).<sup>114</sup> The «menu» of 1886 is at hand, a Lucullan feast:

1. Vegetable soup (minestra da giuta).

2. Salami with ham.

3. Meat with potatoes.

4. Macaroni and chestnuts.

5. Cheese with cherries in wine.

6. A piece of polenta.

7. Cheese.

8. Coffee.

Bon appétit! Seven persons dined: two church wardens, two rectory wardens, two alms wardens and also sexton Stefan.<sup>115</sup>


### 4. The Rectory House

About the location of the first rectory house nothing is known with certainty. It is said that it stood on the site of the present house of Victor Cabalzar. Through the will of the owner it had come into the possession of the rectory or Mission. Here the fathers had taken lodging in the autumn of 1649. In 1670/71 it was restored at considerable cost. It received a new roof, new rooms, doors and windows in order. The fathers, P. Paul d'Agnesogno, vice-prefect, and P. Francestg da Caino, reportedly contributed a good deal themselves.<sup>116</sup> On 24 February 1682 it burned down.<sup>117</sup> The pastor at that time was P. Patricio da Brescia, from 1677 to 1684. According to an account book of P. Bernardino da Concesio (at Cumbel 1704–1709), who noted down the expenses from records found, the father pastor Patricio collected and contributed more than 1000.– fl. for building the new rectory house.<sup>118</sup> This refers to the one that burned down in 1952 and that stood on the same site as the present one. From the same period, ca. 1684, a «barn of the rectory» (clavau dalla pervenda) was also built – presumably the one that stood behind the house. For that the father had given «to the woodworkers, for beams and for building the walls» 40.– fl. He had purchased a small meadow beside the house for 18.– fl. as well as «the site of the garden next to the house of Gion Caduff<sup>119</sup>».

On 4 August 1952, a day of fine and quiet weather, around 11:30, flames snaked up from the roof of the barn below the rectory house of farmer (pasterner) Murezi Caduff-Casanova. The building together with the barn of Gion Gieri Arpagaus right next door collapsed into ashes. From the rectory house the valuables, especially the archive, were rescued. The men were up on the hills haymaking. As the column of smoke rose into view, they hurried over. Men from Duin had arrived even before them with tractors. Soon three lines of hydrants were set up. But the fire had already caught the rectory barn, the woodsheds and the wooden parts of the house. The concern was reportedly to save the new schoolhouse and the church. The Blessed Sacrament had been transported by sur Baselgia to the chapel of Our Lady (Nossadunna), «where women and children were praying and beseeching God's help in the grave moment». Church furnishings and vestments had also been rescued. A line of water ran through the church and over the stairway and through the door of the passageway (lautget) that connected the church with the rectory house. «Twice the shingles under the church roof caught fire, which could still be extinguished in time.» When the motorized fire brigade from Glion arrived, the danger had been overcome. The fire was restricted to the burning objects. Of the rectory house little remained other than the bare walls: the roof structure, the upper floors and the second story in part had been the prey of the fire. But thanks to the calm of the wind, the village remained preserved from a catastrophe.<sup>120</sup>

The burned house is described by its last occupant, sur Baselgia, as follows: «The rectory house was, without the later wooden annex, a respectable, well-proportioned building with partly massive arched openings and an imposing façade; however, at the rear, almost all the way up to the upper floor and the back part, kitchen etc., set on piles. But there still existed a half-arched cellar from the old days, which with the new house was filled with rubble and walled up with the new wall above the house.» In the rectory house, «up in the attic and in the corridors there was a good deal of old stuff: statues, two larger paintings, the two lateral altars from the church of S. Murezi, a large crystal glass chandelier etc., which the insurance compensated at 1500.– fr. The pastor's furniture was for the most part saved, while many remains, books and documents etc. were lost through the fire or through the water. From the fire insurance we received 30 400.– fr., for the other objects of the rectory 3560.– fr. – For the time being the pastor was given lodging in the schoolhouse on the upper floor, where he stayed for three years, until the new house was finished.»<sup>121</sup>

For a new rectory house both in stone, as well as one in wood (by Gieri Giusep Arpagaus), plans had been available for some time, with cost calculations. The decision was made in favor of the stone house by the young architect Carli Elvedi, his first work. A building commission was presided over by president Balzer Antoni Arpagaus, who reportedly, as sur Baselgia notes, had great merits in the matter. A finance commission as well as one for a lottery collected 10 000.– fr. from the lottery.

The principal contractors for work on the house were:

- Mason (miradur) Rest Fidel Arpagaus da Cumbel 33 415.– fr.

- Joiner (scrinari) Gieri Giusep Arpagaus 9139.– fr.

- Installer Gieri Caduff 3531.– fr.

- Roofing (tetgaria) Simon Arpagaus, Vella 2359.– fr.

- Flooring (tabliaus) brothers Alig, Vrin 6101.– fr.

- Painter (pictur) Aluis Casutt, Glion 3354.– fr.

- Electrical installation OES 2053.– fr.

- Heating and stove Weibel-Plüss, Cuera 5682.– fr.

- These are only the largest items. Communal labor: 10 hours per voting citizen. Total cost of the new house: 74 267.– fr.

For the payments the parish borrowed 23 000.– fr. from the local Raiffeisen Bank and 10 000.– fr. from the Lumnezian Union of St. Leci. The debts were amortized before the foreseen term of 25 years, thanks to the cantonal equalization fund (fond cantunal d'ulivaziun). – Great merits for the new rectory house were those of the young schoolmaster Giusep Vieli, president of the parish, of whom the chronicler sur Baselgia notes that he had «always acted with care and prudence». Rectory warden was Rest Ant. Arpagaus-Simeon and church warden was Balzer Antoni Caduff-Arpagaus.

On the feast of the Pardon (perdun), 2 August 1955, the house was inaugurated and blessed by dean Anton Schmid in the presence of several clergymen and of the faithful «who, coming in procession, joyfully circled the well-built new rectory house, praying». Sur Baselgia concludes his report with the beautiful words:

«And now may the almighty Lord and Father send his angel to defend, enlighten, protect and govern all the pastors who will dwell therein and all those who go in and out of it.»<sup>122</sup>


### 5. Something about the Salaries

An interesting endowment is that of the cathedral custos Rudolf Travers d'Ortenstein to the church of Cumbel and to 15 others in the Grischun: A mass endowed for his father Gion Travers.<sup>123</sup> The endowment capital was 50.– fl. from Cuera; the interest went to the father. The mass was to be announced the Sunday before and celebrated on the Wednesday, Friday or Saturday of the Ember Days of Advent (quatertempras d'advent).<sup>124</sup>

The salaries of the fathers cannot be traced continuously. For the year 1876, the revenues for the father are enumerated as follows:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| Interest on capital | 662.– | (without the Rappen) fr. |
| The surplus from endowed masses | 70.– | fr. |
| Interest from the perpetual and non-perpetual register (rodel) | 77.– | fr. |
| Grain of the sacristanship | 42.– | fr. |
| Offerings from the four feasts ca. | 20.– | fr. |
| Offerings from the feasts of Our Lady ca. | 20.– | fr. |
| Grain from the tithe | 250.– | fr. |
| Enjoyment of the plot above the house | 8.– | fr. |
| Five masses per week | 260.– | fr. |
| Total | 1 409.– | fr. |

Charges against the above are named: Wine for the youth for the parade, meal (gentar) for the churchwardens and wine on St. John's Day (vin s. Gion).<sup>125</sup> At that time the salaries for pastors were about 1000–1200.– fr.

On the other hand, the pay for the father's housekeeper (fumitgasa) was modest enough. For 1708 P. Pietro Maria notes: «Magreta Gion Thomas da Cumbel is to receive annually 8 Ster of household grain and a pair of shoes, with the obligation to serve in the house and in the garden.» And below it states: «1710, 10 October. The above contract is confirmed by us P. Bartolomeo and P. Felice.»<sup>126</sup> In 1758 Maria Nesa Arpagaus was «contracted» for 12 Rhenish per year. In 1769, 1771 and 1772 Maria Lita Collenberg was hired for the same pay of 1 fl. per month. In 1808 the pay for the poor housekeeper was still only 13.20 per year «and an apron (scussal) and a pair of shoes<sup>127</sup>». It would be useful to know approximately what value the Rhenish or florin had then. This can never be determined exactly, only from comparisons. Thus P. Ludivic sold around 1772 a turkey (salvanori) for 16.– fl. and in 1775 one for 18.– fl.<sup>128</sup> In 1796 a load (sauma) of rice at the fair of Cuera cost 48.– fl. and for a bottle of Alicante wine one paid there 1 fl. and 30 Rizer, and a bottle of Madeira cost as much as 2.– fl.<sup>129</sup>

From a diary of sometime before 1866, we learn approximately the pay of the sacristan: «A meadow with ca. 4 tschuncheismas of hay, some fields, one cannot say exactly. For digging a grave 1.70 fr. and two loaves of bread and two Krene of cheese. For the bell-ringer (caudon) 57 Rappen. For sweeping and washing the church, doing laundry and tending to daily things fr. 5.–. From the church fr. 6.– as rent for a plot of the sacristanship, sold long ago. Twice a year a loaf and a half per household, in June and December, called 'il paun s. Gion' (St. John's bread), ca. 70 households.» One loaf = 35 Rappen.<sup>130</sup>



## IV. The Parish Church

At the eastern boundary of the commune of Cumbel, beyond Porclas, beside the old road of the Lumnezia, a plot rises, called Plaun Baselgia. Alongside, the water of a ditch gurgles, called Fontauna digl Aitar (Fountain of the Altar). Whence these names? Was there a chapel here? Perhaps the first on the territory of Cumbel, of the Lumnezia altogether? Perhaps a Carolingian one? Or even one from pre-Christian times, as at Grepault/Trun?<sup>131</sup> Perhaps time may yet bring light into this darkness of the past.


### 1. The Sanctuary

Of our church of St. Stiafen (Stephen) we have rather late reports. Much earlier a chapel of St. Murezi (Maurice) is mentioned, already in the imperial register of ca. 825.<sup>132</sup> An inscription, however: «St. Stephane, ora pro nobis 1597» on a bell from Camuns – and Camuns together with Peiden formed a neighborhood with Cumbel — indicates, though also only indirectly, the patron saint of Cumbel.<sup>133</sup> Remarkably, the first father pastor at Cumbel, P. Ireneo, always writes in the baptismal registers, there where the church patron is mentioned at all: «in the parish church of S. Murezi and St. Stiafen.»<sup>134</sup> For what reason? Out of regard for the older church? Regard for the patron of the valley? Or is it merely a personal predilection of P. Ireneo? Already his successor and all the others always cite only St. Stiafen as the church patron of Cumbel.

From the construction elements of the present parish church it can be ascertained that the oldest part, namely from the bell tower back to the gallery (lautga), dates from the Gothic period, from the end of the 15th or beginning of the 16th century.<sup>135</sup> Of an even older church there are no indications at hand. The original nave was thus a good deal shorter and terminated at the front with a small Gothic choir. The paintings with the Joys of Our Lady on the upper side and with the Battle of Mundaun on the lower side could have been made about a hundred years later and perhaps even by the well-known painter and master Hans Ardüser, who is known to have also worked in the Lumnezia, for example on the chapel of St. Roc at Vella.<sup>136</sup> The protocols of the episcopal visitation in the Lumnezia of 1623 and 1643, which otherwise provide good information about several churches<sup>137</sup>, make no mention of Cumbel.

The further parts of the church, the part from the gallery and the bell tower onward with the spacious choir, the sacristy and naturally the two chapels in the nave, date from the Baroque period of the second half of the 17th century. But also the Gothic part was at that time thoroughly Baroquified, not only through those chapels, but also through the cornices all around, up high under the vault and through the windows. From outside the façade catches the eye, with its two horizontal cornices. The distinctive feature of this church is its sgraffiti all around the exterior. They are primarily framing of the windows. At the choir and the sacristy, however, the sgraffiti considerably exceed that function and become an independent mural decoration: A row of ornaments with architectural motifs, vault segments, floral designs and palms in Baroque splendor that evidently betrays a southern origin.

The high altar is a retable of pomp and display with six turned columns with the application of gold leaf in the channels. Above it is crowned by the Coronation of Our Lady with the three divine Persons and a beautiful Madonna. The group is framed by angels, figures and ornaments, all teeming. It enshrines in the center the church patron St. Stiafen. A beautiful carved antependium with a medallion of the Christ Child among the doctors – according to Poeschel it is the four holy Fathers of the West.<sup>138</sup> – The tabernacle is a quite imposing small temple with turned columns, covered by a curved gable. The altar is a work by Johannes Trubmann, according to Poeschel from Schleitz or Schleis in the Tirol<sup>139</sup>, from the year 1763. The artist worked at Cumbel. He had free lodging there and firewood and a pay of 800.– fr.<sup>140</sup> – The two lateral altars match one another, each with two turned columns, framed by acanthus leaf. They may be from the 18th century; Poeschel dates them 1710–1720.<sup>141</sup> In the niches there were statues of Our Lady and St. Joseph, new, in a style now surpassed. Since the restoration of 1978/79, St. Peter and St. Paul are presented there, two splendid figures that were previously placed beside the high altar, each in the place of the middle column removed during the restoration of 1942. Earlier they stood on the reliquaries, to the right and left of the altar. – In the chapel on the right are the stations of the Way of the Cross from the chapel of S. Murezi, composed and framed in a communal frame, before the restoration of 1978/79 in that form in the left chapel. In the latter, with the last restoration, the contours of a niche and of the paintings of St. Dominic and St. Catherine of Siena were uncovered, now all renewed. – The pulpit (scantschala), of polygonal form, from ca. 1690, is decorated with Rococo ornaments from around 1750.<sup>142</sup> Opposite, a holy bishop, presumably St. Valentine, Rhaetian apostle, looks down from a console.<sup>143</sup> The figure is a gift from the parish of Domat, given through the mediation of sur Gion Martin Pelican, on the occasion of the last restoration. – The choir stalls (truccas), with carved panels framed by Corinthian columns, may plausibly derive from the last years of the 17th century. – The church moreover possesses two beautiful silver chalices, one from 1751, a gift of the Capuchin fathers, and presumably the other as well.<sup>144</sup> The *charnel house* (curner) is a building in its own right and original, with two stories, with its eight square niches with heads and paintings of Purgatory, Our Lady, St. Stiafen and St. Murezi. It was renovated in 1974. – A solemn «Memento mori».


### 2. Restorations

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-08.jpg" caption="Restoration 1978/79" %}

The account book of P. Bernardino da Concesio (at Cumbel 1704–1709) reports, deplorably however too little precisely, on certain repairs and acquisitions, such as work on the bell tower 1670<sup>145</sup>, extension of the church to the rear 1673<sup>146</sup>, the baptismal font 1674<sup>147</sup>, a painting or a statue of St. Stiafen<sup>148</sup>, furthermore certain paintings in the interior and on the façade 1680<sup>149</sup>.

Under P. Basilio d'Iseo 1684–1703 and P. Zaccarias da Salò 1684–1705 the great building period began with the erection of the new choir, the sacristy with the room above, the choir stalls and the two lateral chapels. We can follow here the aforementioned account book:

- 1684, purchased for the church three pairs of beautiful cushions (plumatschs?) of damask with antependium and a amice. Improved the rectory by having walls and fences (seifs) built around the garden, in all fl. 76.–

- For making the new choir, labor and material and paving of cut stone, without the alms of various benefactors, put in from the hospice: fl. 400.– Put in for making the room above the sacristy: fl. 30.–

- For cupboards in the sacristy, given fl. 6.–

- For the rectory barn, both to the masters and for timber and other things: fl. 40.– For the tabernacle, without the alms: fl. 80.–

- For purchasing from Gion Caduff that site toward the east next to the rectory house: fl. 18.–

- For building the walls of the garden: fl. 15.–

- For the choir stalls and the varnish: fl. 130.–

- For the walls of the cemetery: fl. 50.–

- For two candlesticks for the high altar and gilding them: fl. 40.–

- For paving the church with cut slabs: fl. 43.–

- For a chasuble (plauna) of brocade: fl. 80.–

In the same register there are still several smaller items for church furnishings.<sup>150</sup> In the year 1709 the two lateral chapels were broken open.<sup>151</sup> In 1873 the church received new windows.<sup>152</sup> In 1882 a pavement of slabs was laid in the choir and in the area before the steps in the nave.<sup>153</sup> The stone with a Latin inscription under the window of the sacristy is a memorial made by the companions of a poor Italian laborer, Cassarmi, who died and was buried here. The text was dictated by P. Bonaventura.<sup>154</sup> In 1897 the assembly of 1 March resolved «to make the church walkway of cement». Executed by Hardegger, Schluein.<sup>155</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-09.jpg" caption="The altars after the restoration of 1979" %}

There followed three more partial renovations: 1905/07 under P. Urban, 1942 (sur Cristoffel Fetz) and 1955 by sur Baselgia, all three in the long run not satisfactory. From the first, the gallery received a new balustrade, the pulpit the colors white and yellow, the chapel altars new ones of simple joinery work, the vault received paintings of the Heart of Mary, St. Francis and St. Stiafen, the arch of the choir a paschal lamb, and the portal and windows received the then-fashionable round arch, and in all this a good deal of the earlier paintings was destroyed. At that time a large plaster votive offering of St. Anthony had also been placed in the right chapel on the altar, which stood there until 1955. At the time of that restoration (1905/07) or shortly after, a ditch was dug around the church to combat the humidity, but too shallow, so that it did not help much. The debts from this restoration had to be paid off until the 1940s.<sup>156</sup>


{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-10.jpg" caption="The organ, 1979" %}


In 1942 sur Cristoffel Fetz (†1961) worked on the high altar by having it gilded and by deplorably removing from each side the two middle columns and placing in their stead St. Peter and St. Paul, previously beside the retable on the reliquaries. The two doors to the sacristy disappeared and were replaced by canvas antependia. The work was executed by the firm Xaver Stöckli of Stans. Sur Fetz financed «his» restoration with private donations.<sup>157</sup>

Around 1955 sur Lezi Antoni Baselgia (†1965) carried out a partial restoration of the nave, uncovering the existing paintings of the Ten Joys of Mary, the images of the apostles, the Battle of Mundaun, making a new gallery and setting it lower, renovating the organ, replacing the two altars in the chapels. The one on the left side received the stations of the Way of the Cross set in a communal frame. The panels derive from the chapel of S. Murezi. The chapel on the right side was fitted with a large confessional. Door and windows received again their rectangular form. Restorers: Firm Xaver Stöckli, Stans. Woodwork: Gieri Giusep Arpagaus, Cumbel. Against the humidity a ditch of two meters' depth was dug on the upper and rear sides and the foundation was renewed all around. – The total cost of a good 30 000.– fr. was paid by sur Baselgia from offerings and collections. For heating, since 1958 two electric stoves by «Rapidor» served, supplied by the firm «Intertherm», Zurich, for 3268.– fr. They served more or less until 1978.<sup>158</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-12.jpg" caption="The chapel on the upper side with the baptistery 1979" %}

The last – a total and integral restoration – was carried out in 1978/79. On Sunday, 9 September 1979, the renovated sanctuary was inaugurated and blessed by sur vicar general Giusep Pelican as representative of the absent diocesan bishop.<sup>159</sup> The work was this time not carried out under the aegis of more or less only the pastor, but rather borne by the entire parish with its building commission in union with the cantonal and federal monument preservation authorities, since it was recognized that such an undertaking on a historic building could only be carried out in this way, in accordance with art history and its principles. The principal works are: The bell tower received a new cap, a new coat from top to bottom and a clock. The exterior of the church entirely renewed with the original sgraffiti. The high altar restored to its original state. The lateral altars lowered by about 50 cm, in their niches St. Peter and St. Paul, previously beside the high altar. The left chapel uncovered to its original state with the paintings of St. Catherine and St. Dominic and with Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of 1886. New pews with the old finials. New balustrade for the gallery. The sacristy entirely new with hot water installation. New lighting, new modern electric heating and new double windows. These are only the principal items. Total cost: 775 742.– fr. The financing was as follows (round figures):

| | | |
|-:| - | - |
| 1 | Building fund, church restoration administered by the parish office (pastor Felici Maissen), which includes private donations, collections in several parishes of the diocese, offerings in church, home mission, a bazaar by the mothers' union, lottery of the building commission, testament of Giachen Camenisch (9000.– fr.) | 349 000.– fr. |
| 2 | Campaign of the central address bureau, Lucerna (administered by parish president, schoolmaster Giusep Vieli) | 136 000.– fr. |
| 3 | Campaign Winterthur. The parish of the Sacred Heart of Jesus holds a large bazaar etc. (of its own initiative), organized under the parish council, November 1978, received January 1979 | 43 000.– fr. |
| 4 | Private donation for the church clock (Caduff-Brennwald, Urdorf) | 15 400.– fr. |
| 5 | Donation from the fund «Fundaziun Winterhalter» (president dr. Gieri Vieli, Domat) | 30 000.– fr. |
| 6 | Contribution from the Corpus Catholicum | 80 000.– fr. |
| 7 | Contribution from cantonal monument preservation | 40 000.– fr. |
| 8 | Contribution from the political commune of Cumbel (for cemetery, bell tower) | 56 985.– fr. |
| 9 | Contribution from federal monument preservation, Bern, promised | 91 250.– fr. |
|  | (communicated on 11 November 1980, with the addition that payment could take place, on the basis of the order of priority, in the year 1985)<sup>160</sup> |  |


At that time it was also envisaged to realize a new organ in due course. The work was carried out under the aegis of:

1. *Building commission:* a. Parish council: Giusep Vieli, president, Madalena Cabalzar-Arpagaus, secretary, Luis Caduff, treasurer, Francestg Arpagaus, assessor (gerau), sur Felici Maissen, pastor and representative of the episcopal curia. Additionally: Rest Fidel Arpagaus-Cavegn, Schoolmaster Rest Giachen Caduff, Robert Elvedi-Caduff, Josefina Collenberg-Caduff, Nesa Furger, Valgronda.

2. *Planning and design:* architect dipl. BSA/SIA Damian M. Widmer, Lucerna-Morissen.

3. *Supervision of works:* Robert Elvedi, architecture office.

4. *Consultation* on monument preservation matters: Dr. A. Wyss and Dr. H. Rutishauser, cantonal monument preservation. Signur Zindel, cantonal archaeology service. C. de Pianta, federal expert for monument preservation. Rev. sur canon and vicar general Giusep Pelican, representative of the curia in matters of sacred art.

5. *Art restorer:* Jörg Joos, Andeer.<sup>161</sup>

A few further acquisitions may also be noted. A *clock* was possessed by the church at least from 1675. In the account book the father notes for that year: «On 25 May master Crest came with the clock.»<sup>162</sup> In January 1800 the pastor P. Tumasch asked the episcopal curia for the faculty to bless the *stations of the Way of the Cross.* These had come from Italy and been paid for by a benefactor. He had, after the last battle at La Punt (against the French, May 1799), made the vow to donate them to the church.<sup>163</sup> On 19 March 1889, P. Nicolaus, pastor, blessed again for the parish church 14 stations of the Way of the Cross.<sup>164</sup> But 20 years later the greater part of them had to be repaired or supplemented, and P. Urban asked for the faculty for a new erection.<sup>165</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-13.jpg" caption="Right lateral altar with St. Paul 1979" %}

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-14.jpg" caption="Left lateral altar with St. Peter" %}

For the 4th Sunday of August 1886, a new *statue of the Queen of the Holy Rosary* – the same that is today in the left chapel – was inaugurated and blessed. A large festive crowd had assembled and in the evening music resounded and fireworks burned. The vow had been made by a young Giovanni Gay d'Alessandria, the homeland of P. Nicolaus, and it had cost 500.– fr.<sup>166</sup>


### 3. Bells and Organ

The first notice of the bells comes from the old account book. In 1677 the father paid for a bell 100 florins.<sup>167</sup> According to a remark in the same place, this bell was brought up from Cuera and fourteen measures of wine were to be given to the eight men who brought it up from Glion.<sup>168</sup> – A bell was cast by Cristian Felix at S. Pieder in 1776.<sup>168a</sup> The present bells were cast by Grasmayr at S. Pieder (Feldkirch) in 1826, the third, which had then cracked, in 1829 by the same bell-founder. The great bell, with a diameter of 124.5 cm, bears the inscription: A FULGURE ET TEMPESTATE LIBERA NOS DOMINE JESU CHRISTE and the figures of the Crucifixion, Our Lady, St. Stiafen and St. Martin. The second has a diameter of 102.5 cm and the inscription SUB TUUM PRAESIDIUM CONFUGIMUS SANCTA DEI GENITRIX and the figures of the Crucifixion, Our Lady, St. Joseph and St. John Nepomuk.

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-15.jpg" caption="The choir stalls (las truccas)" %}

The third, from 1829, measures 91.5 cm and bears the invocation of St. Murezi «patrone noster» (= our patron) and the representation of Our Lady, St. Murezi and St. Bernard of Clairvaux. The small one of 81 cm is adorned with St. Murezi, St. Martin, St. Anthony and the Crucifixion.<sup>169</sup> The bells were consecrated on 12 December 1826, the third on 28 February 1829, by the vicar general of S. Pieder, Bernhard Galura.<sup>170</sup> According to the «urbario Hospizio», the first weighs 1174 kg and is dedicated to St. Stiafen, the second 695 kg and is that of the Immaculate, the third of 467 kg is that of St. Murezi and the small one of 262 kg is the bell of St. Anthony.<sup>171</sup>

*Organ.* The young physician Dr. Gieri Antoni Vieli (1745–1830) had at the assembly of Easter Tuesday 1772 proposed – according to his own note in the protocol book – to install an organ «to achieve a better and more harmonious singing for the honor of God and his saints». The proposal was successful and the commune resolved to take 300.– from the church fund. A collection was held. His father, Murezi Antoni Vieli, gave 100.– fl. and lieutenant Pieder Antoni Arpagaus 50.– fl. Others gave the workers «board» (spisa).<sup>172</sup> More than this cannot be ascertained.

In the year 1902, at the communal assembly of 1 April, it was resolved to procure a new organ and to open a fund for it.<sup>173</sup> On 1 March 1903 the commission reports: The fund has a capital of 388.– fr. from a collection and from singing performances of the church choir and from theater.<sup>174</sup> In the summer of 1904 the commune resolves to borrow 1000.– fr. from the cantonal bank.<sup>175</sup> — In 1955/57 the organ was moved, completed and arranged with two manuals by the firm Willy Buttikofer, Münsingen BE. Inspection on the Sunday of the Most Holy Trinity 1957 by Professor Duri Sialm. Cost 8200.– fr.<sup>176</sup>


### 4. Cemetery

Until 1653 all coffins were transported to the cemetery at Pleif. But upon the dismemberment from Pleif, the new cemetery at Cumbel had already been prepared. With the permission of the Ordinariate, P. Ireneo, in the presence of sur Cristian Arpagaus da Cumbel, pastor at Lumbrein, and of P. Dumeni, blessed the new cemetery. This must have taken place before 28 April 1653, because on that day the first burial took place here, namely the infant of «Gion, son of Gion Blos.»<sup>177</sup> – Some work on the cemetery wall was carried out in 1670 and 1684.<sup>178</sup>

In the year 1959 the cemetery was enlarged, as a joint effort of the commune and the parish, by extending the wall on the lower side, which was in any case quite defective, further into the rectory garden. On that occasion the charnel pit (Fossa dil carner) was also interred.<sup>179</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-16.jpg" caption="The charnel house, restored 1974" %}

In 1974 the charnel house was restored under architect Damian Widmer, Lucerna/Morissen, at a cost of around 40 000.– fr. On that occasion the lower room was emptied and arranged as a mortuary chapel. Three meritorious men: Landrechter Dr. Gieri Antoni Vieli 1745–1830, Dr. med. and mistral Gieri Vieli 1811–1857 and governmental and national councillor Dr. med. Gion Barclamiu Arpagaus 1810–1882 were honored with a commemorative plaque, placed in the small room. The plaques of the two Vieli were already at hand; that of Dr. Arpagaus was newly made. The entire building is under the protection of the cantonal monument preservation.<sup>180</sup>


### 5. Relics

The veneration of relics of the saints has its foundation in Holy Scripture. «When a dead man came in contact with the bones of Elisha, he came back to life.»<sup>181</sup> Already through the shadow of St. Peter the sick received healing.<sup>182</sup> From St. Paul «they took handkerchiefs and aprons and laid them on the sick, and the diseases departed.»<sup>183</sup> – The earliest Christians collected with care the bones of the saints and held them in great honor. The cult of relics has at all times been a part of the devotion of the faithful, whether one venerated relics of the first order (bones) or of the second order (parts of clothing, for example, or things that the saints used).<sup>184</sup> In the Baroque period the veneration of relics came into great fashion. Every church sought to come into possession of relics of the saints, as many and as gladly as possible. The same tendency continued long after, until well into the 19th century.<sup>185</sup>

For the church of St. Stiafen we can compile the following chronological list, in each case according to the authentics (certificates from an ecclesiastical authority that they are genuine).

1. 1698, 25 January. Casparus, Cardinal de Carpineo, vicar general of the Pope, declares authentic the relic, a bone of *Saint Celestina,* martyr, taken from the cemetery of St. Cyriacus.

2. 1700, 24 September. Authentic of the relics of the bodies of the holy martyrs *Pius and Lucida,* from the cemetery of St. Cyriacus, given to rev. sur Augustin Vieli. 1702, 6 March, the bishop of Cuera, Duri de Federspiel, commends those relics to public veneration.

3. 1728, 25 September. Authentic of the holy bone of St. Stiafen protomartyr, placed in the altar of the Most Holy Name at Cumbel.

4. 1730, March. Henricus Lasso de la Vega, bishop . . . declares authentic the *particle of the holy Cross* of Our Lord Jesus Christ, placed in a crystal crucifix and bound around with a silver thread and given to P. Gianbattista da Chiari, Capuchin and missionary in Rhaetia<sup>186</sup>, who placed the crucifix in a silver monstrance for the church of St. Stiafen . . . for the public veneration of the faithful . . .

5. 1730, 8 February . . . Particle of the holy bone of *St. Joachim,* father of Our Lady . . . for the public veneration of the faithful in any church or chapel . . . given to the church of St. Stiafen at Cumbel by Stefano Vieli in the year 1768

6. 1764, 28 May. Authentic of the holy bone of *St. Ubald,* bishop . . .  
Authentic of the holy bone of *St. Ludivic,* bishop. For the public veneration of the faithful. Joannes Antonius de Federspiel, bishop of Cuera

7. 1767, 24 March. Roma, Fr. Nicolaus Angelus Maria Landini . . . attests to having given a particle of the bone of *St. Stiafen* protomartyr, taken from an authentic place . . . for public veneration.

8. 1782, 26 May. Authentic of the relic of the bone of *St. Anthony* of Padua in a small silver reliquary . . . 1784, 16 July. The above-mentioned relic of St. Anthony may be exposed for public veneration, Cuera. Dionis v. Rost, bishop.

9. 1819, 4 October. Cardinal Patrizi verifies the particle of the wood of the *Holy Cross* of Our Lord Jesus Christ, taken from an authentic place and placed in a crystal casket . . .

10. 1819, 4 October. Authentic of the relics, particles of the *tomb of Our Lady, of the mantle of St. Joseph* her spouse, and of the *bone of St. Joachim* in a silver-plated casket.

11. 1841, 29 January. Authentic of a particle of the wood of the *Holy Cross,* of the bone of *St. Prosper,* martyr, of *St. Germana,* martyr, and of *St. Modestus,* martyr.

12. 1841, 10 March. Fr. Joseph Maria Castellani, bishop . . . authentic of particles of the bone of *St. Fidel* of Sigmaringen, martyr in Rhaetia.

13. 1845, 18 October. Authentic for the particles *of the tomb of Our Lady* and of the *bone of St. Philomena,* virgin and martyr. \[on the back it states:\] «Donated by P. Angelo Maria da Camino, apostolic missionary, to the church of Cumbel 1846.»<sup>187</sup>

14. 1853, 6 August. Authentic of particles of the bone of *St. Victoria,* virgin and martyr, placed in a silver-plated, oval casket.<sup>188</sup>

Together with this relic of St. Victoria, P. Bonaventura had also procured an «entire St. Victoria», martyr, and exposed her for the public veneration of the faithful, «who flocked in great numbers to honor such a martyr». And as can be seen from a letter to the episcopal chancellor, the father wished to expose St. Victoria under the table of a lateral altar.<sup>189</sup> The glass sarcophagus with the wax figure of St. Victoria was until the restoration of 1942 on the side of the high altar.<sup>190</sup>



## V. The Chapels

### 1. S. Murezi

Murezi (Maurice) was the leader (primicerius) of the so-called «Theban Legion» of the Roman army, consisting of Christian soldiers, stationed in the lower Valleis (Agaunia). He suffered martyrdom between the years 280 and 300. About a hundred years later, around 380, with the erection of a basilica over his tomb at St-Maurice, his veneration began and spread far and wide. From there grew the monastery of that place and a pilgrimage site, and the veneration of the popular saint, promoted by princes and dynasts, spread with its roots far and wide into the many European lands.<sup>191</sup>


#### a) The Chapel

How the veneration of St. Murezi came to the Lumnezia, we are at present as little informed as about the origin and motive for the erection of a chapel in honor of this saint. The first notice of this chapel, which thus already existed in the first half of the ninth century, we have from the imperial register of 825.<sup>192</sup> It belongs to the oldest sanctuaries of the valley. Remarkably, it is not the patron saint of the ancient parish church of Pleif, St. Vintschegn (Vincent), who was chosen as patron of the valley, but St. Murezi. He appears on the seal of the court and of the community and still today adorns the communal coat of arms. In a letter of indulgence of the parish church of Pleif from 1345, the chapel of St. Murezi is mentioned, but not one of St. Stiafen.

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-17.jpg" caption="S. Murezi at the schoolhouse" %}

Around 1700 the old chapel had become dilapidated. And the new era of the great animation of the Baroque demanded a new building. They wanted to build further down by the road, while the Ordinariate wanted it on the old site.<sup>193</sup> They had already begun to build down there, so the legend tells, but by night the stones were transported up, to where the chapel stands today.<sup>194</sup> – At the latest in 1703 they began building. P. Bernardino da Concesio, at Cumbel 1704–1709, noted in his account book for the year 1703 an expense of 282.– fl. for building the church of S. Murezi.<sup>195</sup> For 1705 he noted the following:

«For finishing the erection of S. Murezi and for the vault and for the bell tower, given of our money to master Giovanni Battista Pedrosso fl. 36.– For beams (aissas) purchased at Peiden, for making the arches of the vault, fl. 2.3. For large and small nails (guotas) for making the roof of the bell tower fl. 10.– For the cross of the bell tower. — For red earth (terra rossa) for painting the bell tower. — 1.2 fl. Given to master Paul for making the roof of the bell tower of S. Murezi, of ours: fl. 2.10. Given to master Christ of Peiden 'per i telari grandi murati vel muro delle fenestre' (for the large frames walled or wall of the windows), of ours 2.8 fl.– Item to the blacksmith of Degen for hooks (gavuns) for securing the beams of the bell tower 2.10 fl. For having a door made for the church of S. Murezi, nails and all fl. 8.2.»<sup>196</sup>

In subsequent years the father still notes expenses for church furnishings as follows:

1707, 7 April. For laying the floor in the church of S. Murezi, with cut stone, given to the master for his work fl. 18.7. For the two paintings of the lateral altars, of St. Joseph and St. Anthony, given to master Giovanni da Glion fl. 48.– from alms and of ours, and for painting those two pictures, given to the painter of Camuns in all fl. 25.–. For printed cloth for three antependia of the altars 3.1 fl.<sup>197</sup>

On 10 August 1710 the painter Giacomo Goliatmetti da Chiavenna agreed with the father to make the painting of S. Murezi on horseback for the high altar, for 15 filippos. The mistral Gieli Arpagaus, warden of the chapel, had promised to pay for the painting. In July 1711 the painter arrived with the panel.<sup>198</sup>

In June/July 1716 the prince-bishop of Cuera, Duri de Federspiel, consecrated several churches in Surselva on the occasion of his pastoral visit and confirmation.<sup>199</sup> On 30 June he confirmed at Cumbel and consecrated the chapel of S. Murezi with three altars «in honor of the Most Holy Trinity, of Our Lady and of the Most Holy Name and in memory of the glorious martyr of Christ, St. Murezi». The high altar in honor of St. Murezi received relics of the martyrs St. Florian, Reparat and Ventura. In the second, on the left, relics of St. Clementina and Ventura and of other martyrs were deposited, and it was dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows. In the third, in honor of St. Joseph, relics of the martyrs St. Lucian, Alexander and of St. Ventura were embedded. For that day the bishop granted an indulgence of one year and for the anniversary each time one of 40 days. The anniversary of the consecration was fixed on the first Sunday of July.<sup>200</sup>

Above the painting of the high altar with S. Murezi on horseback by Goliatmetti there is yet another painting of S. Murezi with his companions, in cuirass and armor, without signature, which may date from the beginning of the 17th century, according to Poeschel presumably by Hans Jakob Greutter of Brixen. Another painting by the same hand, with Our Lady, St. Stiafen and St. Vintschegn<sup>201</sup>, was from the renovation of 1935 deposited in the rectory house and burned in 1952<sup>202</sup>.

The small bell, 47.5 cm diameter, was cast by Raghet Matthis in 1782; the large one, 49 cm, dedicated to S. Murezi, was cast in 1813 by Josef and Bonifaz Walpen of Reckingen.<sup>203</sup> – In 1899 P. Leonard received, upon his request, the permission of bishop Gion Fidel Battaglia to erect the Way of the Cross.<sup>204</sup>

Already in July 1933 sur Const. Theus (1924–33) had presented to the communal council a plan for the restoration, at a cost of 4000.– fr. The council agreed to proceed.<sup>205</sup> Shortly after his entry, sur Cristoffel Fetz (1933–42), in agreement with the parish, had the chapel partially restored by the firm Xav. Stöckli, Stans. The two lateral altars were removed and deposited in the attic of the rectory house, there to be lost forever in the fire of 1952: «two quite imposing small altars with two columns, Baroque crown in blue color». In place of the altars were set the votive statue of Our Lady of Lourdes and that of St. Joseph. The panels of the Way of the Cross were stored in the neighboring house. From there they came in 1956 to the parish church.<sup>206</sup> Simon Albert Arpagaus made new pews, door, windows and cupboard, as sur Fetz writes, «with great devotion and very little money<sup>207</sup>». In 1952, on 14 August, only ten days after the fire of the rectory house, lightning struck the bell tower, dislodged a large «fork from the wall of one of its corners, went through the rear wall behind the altar and down the left side of the altar, smashed the walkway to pieces and shattered almost all the window panes<sup>208</sup>».


#### b) Sacristan and Sexton (Migiur)

Until around 1930 the sexton (migiur) and at the same time sacristan of S. Murezi lived in the house next to the church. It was usually a rather needy family with several children.<sup>209</sup> In the regulations of 1893 it states: «The sacristanship of S. Murezi has always been considered a foundation in favor of poor families and therefore poverty should also be taken into account in the election.»<sup>210</sup> The sacristan/sexton was elected by the communal assembly. From the assembly of 1 March 1860 it was resolved: «that the sacristan of S. Murezi should henceforth be appointed for four years and that he should not be re-eligible if there are others who desire the position<sup>211</sup>».

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-18.jpg" caption="S. Murezi, chapel and sacristan's house" %}

The *obligations* of the sacristan were, according to a resolution of 1818, among other things to «maintain the roads of the avalanche barriers (maluardaus) from Porclas to Valgronda, that is to say, what one man and a pair of oxen can do, and what is more work, the commune is obligated to do<sup>212</sup>». According to the regulations of 1893, the sacristan had to ring the bells three times a day and to ring the funeral knells (cuors da bara), in return for a compensation of one loaf of bread and one Krene of cheese. He had to carry the cross «at all processions and parochial functions<sup>213</sup>». Furthermore, he had to take care of the buildings and to lay annually a course of shingles (schlondas) and the laths for the fences. In 1921 there was additionally: «On 1 November he must deliver the total rent to the chapel warden (ugau calustria). If payment is not possible by that date, from then on the harvest remains as security for the rent.» That year the sacristan was elected for a rent of 110.– fr.<sup>214</sup> It appears that much importance was placed on the ringing: «The sacristan of S. Murezi may not absent himself from S. Murezi, so that the ringing of the Angelus (Ave Maria) is not neglected», so the communal law of 1862 stipulates.<sup>215</sup>

The sacristan had the right of use of the house and of the sacristan's lands and paid a small rent. In 1904, for example, 100.– fr. «as heretofore<sup>216</sup>». In 1921, according to the regulations, «the piece of pasture by the church, out to the stream-bed (begl) or the road to Bugneida, is reserved for the sacristan for his own use from spring until the bringing down of the cattle (scargada), so that neither sheep nor domestic livestock may graze in that area. The pasture above the new road and within the ditch may be used by the sacristan at all times.»<sup>217</sup>


#### c) Cultic Importance

The small sanctuary at the entrance of the Lumnezia valley, with the patron saint of the valley, had until the beginning of our century a remarkable cultic importance. On the Monday of the Rogation Days all the parishes of the entire valley, except Val S. Pieder, came in procession to S. Murezi. The father of Cumbel had then to prepare a good lunch (solver) for 12–15 clergymen.<sup>218</sup> A throng of people assembled, stalls were set up, buying and selling took place, and there was a fair and politics. There prevailed, as moreover also in other places where the processions assembled, much disorder and there were even occasional brawls between lads and girls from the different communes.<sup>219</sup>

In the 1870s the clergy began to consider making an improvement. Sur canon Fontana at Pleif had drawn up a draft. According to it, each parish should on the Rogation Days make its procession to one of its own chapels and only on one of those three days visit the neighboring parish. The new plan was submitted to the parishes and accepted by all except three. In those years 1879 and 1880 the processions were held in that manner. However, a vehement opposition arose. Sur Fontana wrote to the curia, among other things: «The innkeepers, the shopkeepers and the bakers have not rested and it is to be expected that they will cause some disorder . . . The chapter has unanimously resolved, with the sole exception of Degen, to beseech the lord bishop to authoritatively order that the new order already initiated be maintained.»<sup>220</sup>

Among the opponents was also the well-known Gion da Farglix (†1894).<sup>221</sup> On the day of the Rogations in 1879 he simply took the processional banner (cafanun) from the chapel of St. Andrew and set out with 8 to 10 of his adherents in procession up through Lumbrein and out of the valley to S. Murezi. Everywhere he had given orders to have the bells rung when the procession passed through the various villages. If this was not done, he would each time send someone of his party to ring them. P. Nicolo at Cumbel had bolted the door and had the church locked so that the bells would not be rung, and had also had the chapel of S. Murezi locked. It appears that Gion da Farglix also found some partisans at Cumbel. Four «rebels» of Cumbel, as he titles them in a letter to the episcopal curia, had opened the church of St. Stiafen and rung the bells while the procession of Gion da Farglix passed through the village, and they had also opened the chapel of S. Murezi. There Gion da Farglix delivered a sermon. What he actually said, the few listeners cannot really say, but probably he uttered more blasphemies than words. In the same manner as the procession had come, it returned. The following year, 1879, Gion da Farglix again repeated his «schismatic» procession. To a plea from the pastor of Lumbrein, sur Caviezel, to abandon this private procession, Gion da Farglix replied in a letter of 16 May 1879, among other things: «A year ago I resolved to go as long as God grants me health and firmness that I can make the journey; I shall not desist from visiting that old chapel of S. Murezi on that day. Not, however, to give pleasure to Peter or Paul, as is claimed. I have neither asked anyone to keep me company nor pushed anyone away, and thus I shall also continue to do henceforth.» The following year, on the first day of the Rogations, the same thing happened again from Farglix and St. Andrew's to Valgronda. The father of Cumbel made scenes and kept writing to the bishop about that «processione scandalosa e scandalosi eccessi di quel Gion di Farlix e suoi proseliti» (scandalous procession and scandalous excesses of that Gion di Farlix and his proselytes).

Meanwhile, during the years 1879/80, there was much agitation and intrigue against the new order. A Lumnezian correspondent had written to the editorial office of the Gasetta Romontscha such an upset article against the new plan that the editorial office did not dare publish it and instead wrote in the next issue: «According to a Lumnezian correspondence, it appears that in that valley there is among many still much discontent with the new order of the processions of St. Mark's Day and the Rogations . . . but the fact is that the entire Lumnezian clergy was in agreement with this new order and that the lord bishop approved it . . . and therefore we would advise submitting to this measured reform». However, the agitation continued. Even the district court involved itself in the matter. In April 1880 a vote was held in all communes, with the result of 427 votes for returning to the old order and only 55 for continuing with the new. To prevent the old disorders, bishop Constantin Rampa ordered for the Lumnezia «that those who go with the procession to the designated place return together with the procession and that the procession of each parish, after about one hour after the mass, set out promptly on the way back<sup>222</sup>». Also the commune of Cumbel had voted on 6 March 1881 unanimously with 66 votes to return «to the old footing<sup>223</sup>». The last time those processions from all the parishes of the Lumnezia assembled at S. Murezi was in the year 1908.<sup>224</sup>


### 2. The Chapel of Our Lady (Nossadunna)

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-19.jpg" caption="Old chapel of Our Lady" %}

Until 1928 there stood an old chapel of Our Lady within the village of Cumbel, where the old road crossed the Val-mulin, within the present course, right at the edge of the stream-bed. One corner already stood unsupported and had received some propping. The building was covered with a roof of heavy slabs and measured 5 m in length and almost the same in width. On the small altar was a painting of Our Lady with St. Andrew and St. Roch and with the founder of the painting or of the chapel, on his knees before Our Lady. The chapel showed wide cracks in the masonry and the moment of collapse came ever closer.

For this reason the old chapel was demolished in the year 1928 to be replaced in a safer location by the present chapel, a work carried out under the aegis of the pastor of that time, sur Constantin Theus.

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-20.jpg" caption="New chapel of Our Lady" %}

He published on the same occasion a short treatise, both on the old chapel and on the erection of the new one.<sup>225</sup> The author cites a document of 1789, written by a certain Hercli Antoni Arpagaus.<sup>226</sup> In it the founder of the chapel, a certain Giachen Antoni Caheni, is named.<sup>227</sup> He had charged his descendants to maintain a light in the chapel during the night of Saturdays and vigils. This had also been observed. The founder of the chapel, Caheni, a herdsman in the alp of Seglias, overtaken by a thunderstorm (madernatscha), had made the vow to Our Lady to build this chapel in her honor if things should improve. So the legend tells. It may well rest on one or another similar account. The man on his knees before Our Lady on the altarpiece evidently indicates an ex voto. The painting is now in the new chapel, on the right wall.

In June 1928 the mason Giovanni Perolo da Sondrio began the work. Since he had undertaken to do all the masonry work entirely by himself, the building took four extended summers. On 27 September 1931 the chapel was blessed by the episcopal vicar sur Cristian Vinzap, pastor at Surcasti. The small bell is the small bell from the old set of bells of Morissen, which had come into private possession and was ceded to the sanctuary of Our Lady. And quite important and interesting is what sur Theus writes at the end of his work:

«In the wall of the façade, about 70 cm below the right corner of the window niche (mesaglina), some copies of the documents of the chapel are hidden, as well as some notes about the commune of Cumbel. The survivors of the next generation, until then the mason's guarantee holds, will find them in the fallen walls.»

Here then will also be the above-mentioned document of 1789, which awaits the collapse of the next generation.


## VI. Clergy

### 1. The Capuchin Fathers, Pastors and Assistants

Sur Cristoffel Willi published in 1960 a voluminous lithographed book on the Capuchin fathers of the Rhaetian Mission on Romansh territory.<sup>228</sup> Our list of the fathers who served as pastors at Cumbel follows his biographical notes from the first and second parts of that work. The fathers were accustomed from the monastery onward to a communal life. They therefore strove as much as possible to maintain this also in the Mission. For this reason they were usually two at the individual posts in the rectory house, or even more in larger parishes with branch churches (exposituras). In the following register we cite all the father pastors under sequential numbering with in each case those fathers who served them for longer or shorter periods. Often, however, it is difficult to ascertain with certainty which of them is actually the pastor. The fathers did – to use the very words of one of them – as good confrères now one and now the other the office of pastor, according to the needs and circumstances of the Mission.<sup>229</sup>

1. *P. Ireneo da Casalmoro, from 1649–1665.*<sup>230</sup>  
Under him there also served, for shorter or longer periods: *P. Benedetto da Brescia,* recorded in the death register only once: 29.11.1653  
*P. Zaccarias da Salò,* baptized here on 25 March 1655. Appears to have been here only in passing, to return then in 1684 under P. Basilio for about 20 years.  
*P. Francesco da Caino* was at Cumbel as assistant and then pastor for at least 22 years, from 1657–1679.<sup>231</sup>

2. *P. Francesco da Bagolino,* documented as pastor only from 7 January to 15 July 1667. Born ca. 1629, he served in the Mission in 1659 at Casti and at Alvaschein and in 1668 at Brinzeuls and at Mulins, at Vaz and at Lantsch.<sup>232</sup>

3. *P. Ambrogio da Fontanella,* documented at Cumbel only from December 1667 to December 1668. His assistant was P. Francesco da Caino. From here he went to the mission at Mulins and Sur until 1678 and in 1679 to Riom. After 16 years in the Mission he returned in 1679 to his province and died in the monastery of Bergamo in 1684.<sup>233</sup>

4. *P. Francesco da Caino,* 1669. He also signs himself Francesco da Brescia. Born ca. 1619, he served in the Mission in 1658 at Brinzeuls and in 1659 at Sevgiein and for the longest time as assistant at Cumbel, as under no. 1.<sup>234</sup>

5. *P. Paul d'Agnosegno,* documented at Cumbel from 10 June 1670 to September 1671. With him as assistant P. Francesco da Caino. With P. Paul, Cumbel had one of the principal Capuchins in Rhaetia. Vice-prefect. During the grave confessional troubles in Graubünden and especially with their arena at Tumegl from 1671–1674, he was at Tumegl, placed there by the papal nuncio Edoardo Cibo. At that time the Protestants threatened to expel the Capuchins from the paritetic localities out of the country.<sup>235</sup>

6. *Marcantonio da Grosio,* from 1671–1676. Born ca. 1629. Served in the mission at Tarasp 1665–1671, and then briefly at Casti 1671. His assistant at Cumbel was still P. Francesco da Caino, who also functioned here during the vacancies of the pastorate.<sup>236</sup>

7. *P. Angelo da Bergamo,* 1677, documented in the baptismal register only briefly from 25 January to 2 February 1677, while he calls himself therein pastor. His assistant P. Francesco da Caino.<sup>237</sup>

8. *P. Patrizio da Brescia,* from 1677–1684. Born ca. 1637. In 1669 he was at Riom as a student of theology, 32 years old, and documented at Riom already 1665–1670, at Brinzeuls 1671, at Lantsch as assistant 1672, at Tarasp 1673–1676. After his departure from Cumbel in 1684 he is no longer to be found in the Mission and probably returned to his province. Died at Tirano 1720. His assistants: the faithful *P.

### 2. The Fathers Depart

By decree of the Congregation de Propaganda Fide of 3 May 1920, the Rhaetian Mission, which had lasted exactly 300 years, was dissolved. At that time 20 parishes or branch churches were being served by fathers of the Mission. The Capuchin Order resolved, in agreement with bishop Georgius Schmid, not to send any more fathers to Rhaetia, «while however leaving ad interim those who are currently in the Mission<sup>267</sup>». The parishes of the Mission were informed by circular. At the communal assembly of Cumbel on 30 October 1921, the matter was discussed and the assembly adopted, according to the protocol, the following resolution: «The commune recalls the great merits of the Mission and consents to a joint petition to the bishopric for the continued retention of the well-deserving Capuchin fathers. Such action should demonstrate gratitude toward the Mission, but should represent no protest vis-à-vis ecclesiastical authorities . . .»<sup>268</sup> By contract of 19 November 1921 between bishop Georgius Schmid and the leadership of the Order it was specified that individual fathers could remain at their posts. Those posts, however, which became vacant through the death of a father or through voluntary retirement, were henceforth to be filled by diocesan clergy. In August 1955 the last father of the Mission, P. Daniele Adamina, left his parish of Casti to retire to his Ticinese province. The parish of Casti, however, was by agreement between the episcopal curia and the Ticinese provincial entrusted to the Ticinese province, on the condition that at least two fathers be stationed there in the service of pastoral care.<sup>269</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-23.jpg" caption="P. Linus, pastor at Cumbel 1917–1923" %}

At Cumbel P. Linus remained two more years. On 29 October 1923 the prefect of the Mission, P. Giovanni, communicated from Casti to the parish of Cumbel, «that the council of the Rhaetian Mission had at its session of 23 October designated P. Linus as pastor at Mulins and as his successor in the pastoral care of Cumbel had elected P. Pieder, until now pastor at Mulins<sup>270</sup>». What transpired in between we do not know; P. Linus did not go to Mulins but rather withdrew with the consent of his superiors into the monastery. Thus he could also not be replaced by P. Pieder. And the parish of Cumbel was now, according to the agreement, in the care of the bishop of Cuera. With fine words the prefect of the Mission took leave of Cumbel: «We therefore take leave of the praiseworthy parish of Cumbel, thanking it cordially for all the devotion and attachment it has always shown toward the Rhaetian Mission, as also toward its fathers during the three centuries of their pastoral care there. May our glorious father St. Francis and our patron and confrère St. Fidel reward it therefor, by imploring upon that parish the richest blessing of the Lord.»<sup>271</sup>

The abandoned parishioners seem to have been somewhat taken aback by the sudden change. The communal council, which believed «that this change is certain», resolved to ask the father prefect «whence the change derived». Shortly after, the reply was there: «to the satisfaction of the parish, since it had officially requested no change<sup>272</sup>». The parish was now in the care of the episcopal curia and would no longer be served by fathers of the Mission.<sup>273</sup> On 29 November 1923 the last father departed through Porclas.

## VII. Religious Life

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-31.jpg" caption="The procession of the Heart of Mary, August 1924" %}

### 1. The Sunday of Our Forefathers

In those days Sunday was truly the day of the Lord. The day of prayer and divine service. Religious worship occupied the greater part of the day. And it began early and well. An agenda of the pastor from 1866 records: «Every Sunday and holy day the office bell is rung in the morning at 6 o'clock. The people come together to say the office, especially young men and young women. At the end of the office confessions are heard.»<sup>301</sup> In the time of P. Urban (1905–1917) the bell was rung at 7 or 7:30 for the office of Our Lady. At 9:30 the bell rang for mass and the people recited the rosary. Then followed sung mass with a sermon of at least half an hour. Every first Sunday of the month the roll of the dead was read out. During the six months of the school period the father gave catechism for the people before vespers.<sup>302</sup> In summer, when there was no catechism, they recited — according to the agenda of 1872 — before beginning vespers, the rosary and the litany of all the saints, and after the sung vespers they recited once more the vespers of Our Lady, and after all that there still followed on every first, second and third Sunday of the month a procession around the church, processions of the various confraternities.<sup>303</sup>

Concerning *catechism,* already bishop Duri de Federspiel had ordered in 1695 that every Sunday, except for important reasons, catechism was to be given for the people, «so that the youth may be instructed in the truths necessary for salvation<sup>304</sup>». And the episcopal ordinances of the year 1760 required that catechism be given and attended «diligently» and that the «schoolmasters» of every locality attend it and «keep the children in good discipline and attention<sup>305</sup>». P. Nicolaus (1871–1895) had had the experience that catechism in church was the cause of arriving either too late or of not appearing at vespers at all. For this reason he had the young men come one Sunday and the young women the next to the rectory house for the catechism. There they were gladly prompt.<sup>306</sup>

The *rest* of Sunday was observed in the 17th/18th centuries most rigorously. Here the Church enjoyed the efficient support of the civil authorities, who enforced it with their mandates, statutes and ordinances of the communities and communes.<sup>307</sup> In his report of the confirmation visitation in Surselva of 1760, bishop Gion Antoni Federspiel laments about the driving with carts and packhorses on Sundays and that otherwise all sorts of forbidden work was done, such as threshing grain, going to the mill, weighing goods, loading and unloading hay and other things. Thereby Sunday was «dishonored and profaned, so that even the Reformed neighbors took offense<sup>308</sup>».


### 2. Holy Days

Besides the obligatory holy days, a number of «devotional holy days» were celebrated, and in addition a considerable number of so-called «minor holy days» (firaus pigns), such as for example St. Anthony on 17 January. For that day P. Nicolaus notes in his agenda of 1872: «S. Antieni, half-holiday or minor holy day, mass at 9, low mass benché sul organo cantano la messa con strofe romancie (although the organ plays the mass with Romansh strophes). After the elevation they begin vespers, which are then finished after mass.»<sup>309</sup> On a minor or half-holiday there was always mass before noon, at 9 or 10 o'clock. Afterwards work resumed.

According to an agenda of 1866, the following number of half-holidays or devotional holy days were celebrated:

- 17 January, St. Anthony, late mass with vespers.

- 21 December, St. Thomas, high mass with sermon and vespers.

- 25–27 December, Christmas, St. Stephen and St. John, high mass, sermon and vespers in the afternoon.

- 28 December, Holy Innocents, devotional holy day, mass with sermon and vespers in the afternoon.

- 31 December, St. Sylvester, devotional holy day, late mass etc.<sup>310</sup>

In addition it should be noted that to this long series of 46 obligatory holy days, devotional holy days and minor holy days, there are still several obligatory holy days such as Ascension, Our Lady of August (Assumption) and All Saints which are of course not even listed. And as at Pentecost, Easter Monday and Easter Tuesday were in any case also devotional holy days with high mass, sermon and vespers. Thus our forefathers came to 51 holy days in addition to or including the 52 Sundays of the year.

Too much of a good thing were in any case the 4 days of Christmas. And it is therefore no wonder if some abuses occurred. One can understand that bishop Johann Anton de Federspiel had to admonish the council of Cumbel, in 1760, to put an end to the «customary misbehavior and scandalous abuses» of the local youth on the feast day of the church patron, St. Stephen.<sup>311</sup>

However, the holy days had to be observed. On this matter the communal assembly of 1 March 1847 resolved: «. . . it is firmly established to impose a fine of one crown for every transgression of forbidden work on obligatory holy days kept in full, without having obtained the permission of the pastor together with the assessors (geraus).»<sup>312</sup> Of a reduction of the holy days they wanted to hear nothing. In the communal law of 1862 paragraph 17 reads as follows: «The devotional holy days, which have been taken up and sanctified by our forebears, and after the proclamation of the dispensation from these, likewise our living elder neighbors being asked whether they wished to keep the holy days or not, having thereupon made the vow to keep them. Persons with building obligations who have to raise buildings are given liberty, but should cease work during the divine services.»<sup>313</sup>

When somewhat later dispensation was granted from certain holy days, the communal assembly of 1 March 1882 resolved «to keep as half-holidays in the morning the dispensed holy days, and after noon permitted to work», that is to make them minor holy days.<sup>314</sup> In 1884 the commune decided «to celebrate the feast days of the apostles with mass and vespers in the morning and to work afterwards», that is also to make them half-holidays.<sup>315</sup> In 1889 the communal assembly specified «to say mass on the feast days of the apostles at 7 and then to work<sup>316</sup>». With that the half-holiday of the apostles was liquidated.


### 3. Confraternities and Associations

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-32.jpg" caption="Feast of the Heart of Mary 1979" %}

#### a) Confraternity of the Most Holy Name

This is the oldest in our parish. P. Ireneo (1649–1665), the first father, had canonically founded it on 31 August 1659. As titular altar the left lateral one was designated.<sup>317</sup> On New Year's Day, as also the second Sunday after Epiphany, «sung high mass» was celebrated with 4 altar servers at that altar, a sermon given, and after vespers every second Sunday of the month a procession was held around the church, singing the litany of the Most Holy Name.<sup>318</sup> Pope Paul V had granted the brothers and sisters of the confraternity numerous indulgences, namely a plenary one after having done penance and received communion and at the hour of death, as well as on the day of reception. An indulgence was also gained by whoever visited the church and prayed before the altar of the confraternity «for concord among the Christian princes, for the extirpation of heresy and for the exaltation of the holy Catholic Church». These three points recur from that time always again as principal prayer intentions. An indulgence of 100 days was gained by whoever charitably admonished those who blasphemed or swore without need. A truly good spirit of Christian charity and fraternal correction speaks from this provision as also from the following: «An indulgence is gained by whoever accompanies the Blessed Sacrament when it is brought to a sick person, and if he cannot do so, at least prays for the sick person, likewise those who follow a coffin, visit the sick, help or give shelter to the poor, who make peace with their enemies or seek to make peace between adversaries, those who lead sinners to penance, who teach Christian doctrine, who perform other works of charity and piety, each time an indulgence of one hundred days.»<sup>319</sup>

The book of the confraternity contains the name of father Ireneo and of several other Capuchins who served at Cumbel up to P. Urban 1906. There follow numerous lists of the names of the confrères and the sisters up to the year 1921.<sup>320</sup>


#### b) The Company of Our Lady Immaculate

Already one year after the foundation of the first confraternity followed the canonical erection of the second, in 1660, which was aggregated to the archconfraternity of San Lorenzo in Damaso in Rome. In this Company or confraternity especially the various fathers who served at Cumbel enrolled, and then numerous persons, men and women, also many clerics and laypeople from the surrounding area, even from the Foppa (Oberhalbstein), indeed even from Domat. The last enrollments of members date from 1908/1909.<sup>321</sup> As titular altar the lateral one on the right side was chosen. Bishop Gion Antoni de Federspiel, by commission of the Pope, endowed that altar on 20 November 1759 with the so-called privilege, that is, through the celebration of mass at that altar one could gain indulgences for the souls of the departed.<sup>322</sup> Furthermore the members enjoyed the benefit of being able to gain many indulgences, similar to those of the above-named congregation of the Most Holy Name. Among other things, an indulgence of one year was gained by whoever helped poor young women, in honor of Our Lady Immaculate, so that they would not fall into the power of the Evil One and could preserve their honor, and likewise by whoever instructed others in Christian doctrine.<sup>323</sup>


#### c) The Company of Christian Doctrine

The cleric Marco Sadis Cusani of Milan had founded in Rome in the year 1560 a union of clerics and laypeople for teaching the doctrine. From this arose the archconfraternity of Christian doctrine with its seat in Rome and many branches in various countries.<sup>324</sup> The Capuchins in Rhaetia founded here several branches or confraternities of a religious and scholastic character, the first at Vaz ca. 1629. To it there then aggregated the confraternity of Casti 1689 and that of Alvagni the same year; in 1690 those of Savognin, Riom and Sumvitg associated themselves with that of Vaz. In 1693 followed Cumbel, 1695 Termin (Trimmis), 1724 Mustér, 1725 Sagogn and 1744 Camuns and 1751 Beiva/Murmarera.<sup>325</sup>

The Company comprised clerics and laypeople and especially the youth and children. The supreme supervision was held by the diocesan bishop. Every branch had several officials, namely: 1. The *sub-prior,* who was head of the school in his commune. 2. The *adviser* (avisatur), who had to be watchful over the school, visit it, ensure discipline, «keep his lance at hand» etc. 3. The *chancellor* had to register the pupils and all members and to keep book and protocol. 4. *Two conservators* who had to ensure that the pupils and the youth attended school and studied at home etc. 5. *Two recorders* (recordaturs) who had to remind of receiving the holy sacraments and of attending school punctually. 6. *Two infirmarians* who had the obligation of visiting sick pupils. 7. *Two schoolmasters* (scolasts), who had to give instruction in the three classes of children and in the 4th class of adults. 8. The *assistant* (maester), one or more. These were helpers of the schoolmasters. For every eight pupils the schoolmaster had to have one such. 9. The *silencer* (silenzier) had to see to silence and good order. He held a rod in hand.<sup>326</sup>

What was taught was reading, writing, memorizing, singing, and as the principal framework, Christian doctrine. School began on St. Catherine's Day (25 November) and lasted until Easter and took 3/4 of an hour per day. On this subject Prof. Gadola writes, among other things: «On Fridays pupils, boys and girls, assembled in a large room where benches and pews had been set up along the walls. In the middle of the room stood the schoolmasters, each with a small lance in hand, and observed how the male and female teachers instructed each and every one, then they examined them, admonished, praised, tweaked . . .»<sup>327</sup>

At Cumbel the confraternity was founded in the year 1693. The foundation document of this important institution, in the Italian language, reads in free translation:

«We, the Capuchin fathers, apostolic missionaries at Cumbel, P. Basilio d'Iseo and P. Zaccarias da Salò, have obtained with God's help the favor and grace of the permission of the Lord Bishop of Cuera to institute in our church the Company of Christian Doctrine, aggregated to the confraternity of that of Vaz, in accordance with the order and command of the Bull of the archconfraternity of Rome and of His Holiness. To this Company the beginning is given and the publication made on the day of St. John the Baptist, on which solemn day every year the contents of the Bull are read out with the indulgences granted to this Company. The high altar of St. Stiafen is named as titular altar. In this new Company the officials inscribe themselves first and then the confrères and the sisters.»<sup>328</sup>

There follow hereupon the names of the 12 officials of the Company for the year 1697, four years after the foundation:

1. Sub-prior: Captain Gieri Arpagaus. 2. Adviser: weibel Flurin Arpagaus. 3. Chancellor or sexton (scarvon): Sechelmeister Crest Caduff. 4./5. Conservators: Plasch Luregn and Martin Caspar Gion Crest Caduff. 6./7. Recorders: Martin Aspar Caduff and Franz Aspar Arpagaus.

For the year 1694, one year after the foundation of the Company of the Doctrine, about 160 members, nearly two thirds women, enrolled in the confraternity. The membership book contains these registers periodically, at intervals of several years, and this until the year 1894.<sup>330</sup> It goes without saying that the school of the confraternity in the 19th century no longer had the same curriculum as at the beginning and that it concentrated increasingly only on the catechism.


#### d) The Confraternity of the Holy Rosary

The German Dominican father, Jakob Sprenger, prior at Cologne, had erected on 8 September 1475 in the monastery church of Cologne the confraternity of the Holy Rosary, which was then approved and commended by Pope Sixtus V on 30 May 1478.<sup>331</sup> P. Giovanni Battista da Chiavo had introduced this confraternity at Cumbel in the year 1734. Already that same year about 90 of them, men and women, enrolled. The membership lists were continued with interruptions until 1908 under P. Urban.<sup>332</sup> Every first Sunday of the month the father went before the titular altar, that of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary in the left chapel, for the Lauretan litany and to begin the monthly procession around the church.<sup>333</sup> The altar of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary was privileged, that is, endowed with indulgences for Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday.<sup>334</sup>


#### e) The Company of St. Francis

Long before the introduction of the Third Order there existed at Cumbel a «Company of St. Francis», erected probably around 1750. In the parish archive is the book of the association, from the 18th/19th century, but without a date of erection, with more than 300 names «de quelli che sono scritti nella Compagnia del serafico san Francesco» (of those who are enrolled in the Company of the seraphic Saint Francis). The lists begin with 1750 and follow with interruptions until 1890. Among the obligations of the confrères and sisters are cited: 1. «Portare il piccolo cingolo intorno alla vita con trè nodi» (To wear the small cord around the waist with three knots). 2. To pray five Our Fathers daily. Several indulgences were granted.<sup>335</sup>


#### f) The Confraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary

On 2 December 1836 the archbishop of Paris, Hyacinth Quelen, founded the archconfraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the conversion of unbelievers. The confraternity spread rapidly: Within 14 years, by 1851, no fewer than 8000 branches with 14 million members had been erected in several European countries.<sup>336</sup> On 10 April 1845 the pastor P. Bonaventura da Garesio (1839–1862) asked the Congregation de Propaganda Fide in Rome for permission to erect a branch at Cumbel. One month later he received from the prefect of the Congregation, Cardinal Fransoni, the consent. The archconfraternity in Rome had no special vestment for the members and he should also not introduce one. The members enjoyed the spiritual benefits of the archconfraternity.<sup>337</sup> The new confraternity had great success. A register from the time of the foundation contains no fewer than 214 names, beginning with that of bishop Caspar de Cari, father Bonaventura, P. Ottavio da Camuns and with several family names from outside such as for example: Montalta, Camenisch, Casaulta, Bundi, Tönz, Albin Nut, Arquisch, Soler, Demont, Henni, Mirer etc. The membership lists follow with interruptions until 1959.<sup>338</sup> On 7 April 1851 the Cumbel branch was aggregated to the archconfraternity of Einsiedeln (Nossadunnaun).<sup>339</sup> In the year 1945 the centenary was celebrated with a triduum as preparation for the feast of the Heart of Mary.<sup>340</sup>

#### g) The Apostolate of Prayer

This was not a confraternity of its own, but rather a loose association affiliated with the archconfraternity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in Rome, founded on 8 April 1861 and approved by Pope Pius IX in 1866. P. Nicolaus had introduced the Apostolate at Cumbel on 15 December 1873. He won members in great numbers. The lists followed from then on with interruptions until 1921. Then nothing more until 1950. Sur Baselgia writes in the book of the Apostolate: «At the urgent recommendation of Rome and of Cuera through the diocesan director . . . the Apostolate of Prayer, forgotten since 1920, was raised to new life in the Holy Year 1950.» There follows a list with 63 names, the majority female.<sup>341</sup>


#### h) The Third Order of St. Francis

From the «Company of St. Francis» grew the Third Order, founded in 1878 under the aegis of P. Nicolaus. A list from that first year 1878 contains 49 names, 44 female members and 5 men.<sup>342</sup> This is one of the few associations that has been able to survive the chilling post-conciliar winds. Today the Third Order still numbers 25 female members and one male member.


#### i) The Order of the Holy Family

Under this name there follows a list from the year 1908 with 76 families and with still more individual names.<sup>343</sup> Otherwise no other records are to be found about this Order, which appears to have lived a rather feeble existence.


#### k) Union of the Holy Childhood (Sontga Affonza)

A loose association for the support of the missions to the pagans. The members committed themselves to a certain annual contribution to the missions. For the years 1874–1882 there exists a small book with the lists of the members who had paid.<sup>344</sup>


#### l) Union of Mothers

By instrument of 1 April 1933, the vicar general of Cuera, Anton Simeon, in the name of the bishop, granted the faculty to found at Cumbel a branch of the union of mothers, under the title and patronage of Our Lady of Sorrows, as a branch of the archsodality of Regensburg (Regensburger Erzsodalität christlicher Mütter).<sup>345</sup> This union too has been able to maintain itself until today.


#### m) Union of Catholic Women and Young Women of Graubünden

One year later, in 1934, a branch of this cantonal union was formed, with 40 members registered for that year.<sup>346</sup> Still alive today.


#### n) Apostolate of Men

On the occasion of the holy mission under the aegis of P. Tumasch Häberle OSB from 25 October to 2 November 1949, a good number of men and young men gave their names for this Apostolate. They committed themselves to go every first Sunday of the month to receive the holy sacraments, unless legitimately prevented.<sup>347</sup>


#### o) Marian Congregation of Young Women

Launched and founded by sur Leci Antoni Baselgia and canonically erected by mons. bishop Caminada on 30 November 1944.<sup>348</sup>

The present *youth association* is a fusion of the old company of young men and the union of young women, formed around 1968/69, without a cultic-religious character, despite the affiliation with the so-called Ligia da s. Murezi (League of St. Maurice).

Fourteen confraternities or cultic-religious associations in a small parish give eloquent testimony of the lively religious life of those years!


### 4. Processions and Devotions

Besides the above-mentioned monthly processions around the church on every first, second and third Sunday of the month, customary still in the time of P. Urban, from the drive up to the alp (cargada) until the bringing down (scargada), after Sunday mass, each time a procession with the Blessed Sacrament was held around the church. Before the church the procession halted for the Eucharistic benediction. In the church the «Tantum ergo» was sung and once more the benediction.<sup>349</sup> On St. Mark's Day the procession went to Degen. In procession they went, of course, on the Rogation Days, the Finding of the Holy Cross (3 May), Good Friday and Corpus Christi, as also on the feast of the Heart of Mary, the Weather Holy Day (Firau las auras, 26 June), the Visitation of Mary (2 July).<sup>350</sup> On St. George's Day Cumbel processed to Degen. The people clung tenaciously to their religious customs. When for example P. Nicolaus expressed the wish to abandon going to Degen on St. George's Day, the commune resolved to stick to the old way.<sup>351</sup> Then there were still processions for special needs, for example for rain, as far as Vrin, as a communal assembly of 1921 records: «It is resolved to hold a procession to Vrin to pray for rain.»<sup>352</sup> Against abuses at the places where processions assembled<sup>353</sup>, already bishop Gion Anton Federspiel had intervened with his ordinances of 1760: «Also there should be abolished everything that disturbs the devotion of the people on the occasion of solemnities and processions, especially holding fairs and trading near the church during the divine service . . .»<sup>354</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-34.jpg" caption="Feast of the Heart of Mary 1979" %}

*Devotions.* On St. Joseph's Day and certain holy days they held immediately vespers after mass and in the afternoon «compline was sung. Compline was sung every evening during Lent, with the addition of the litany of Our Lady.<sup>355</sup>

In the time of P. Urban (1905–1917) four *novenas* were held: That of the Immaculate, of Christmas, of St. Joseph and of the Holy Spirit.<sup>356</sup> On the evening before a Third (funeral day) or a Month's Mind (caudonn) they sang, still in the time of sur Fetz (1933–1942), the vespers of the dead.<sup>357</sup>


### 5. Missions

The first known parish mission was held in 1845 by P. Bernardino da Ceriano, then pastor at Sagogn<sup>358</sup> and the young cleric Gion Bistgaun Capaul of Lumbrein, later curate at Morissen (1806–1870)<sup>359</sup>. In the year 1873, from 1 to 9 February, P. Basilio da Morovalle, then pastor at Vaz, and P. Donato Bergamin, pastor at Salouf, held a mission at Cumbel. And P. Nicolaus, pastor, cannot praise it enough: «One could not wish for more — immense attendance, general confessions, and sincere tears were the crown of the work.» The lord bishop had granted an indulgence of 40 days to those who, kneeling, prayed even only a short prayer before the mission cross affixed to the wall in front of the church.<sup>360</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-35.jpg" caption="Feast of the Heart of Mary 1979" %}

In 1884, on 26 January, a mission began. The prefect of the Rhaetian Mission P. Antonino Forlano da Badaluzzo (1821–1884)<sup>361</sup> and P. Donato Bergamin of Vaz, pastor at Salouf, had arrived. They delivered three sermons a day, one in the morning, one at 1 o'clock and the third in the evening. On 1 February in the morning P. Antonino said early mass and then went into the confessional. After about half an hour he collapsed face down before the confessional, struck by apoplexy (daguota). He was carried to the rectory house and a doctor, Dr. Riedi, was summoned from Glion.<sup>362</sup> The mission was continued by P. Donato alone. P. Antonino was completely paralyzed on the left side, cared for in the rectory house under the care of Dr. Riedi and Dr. Geronimi.<sup>363</sup> The people of Cumbel took great interest and concern, our chronicler punctually notes. During the three months at Cumbel the left leg improved somewhat, «but the arm and the intellect remained in the same state». On 22 April the sick father was transported to the hospital of the Holy Cross at Cuera. There he remained until 3 June, to then be transported to Vaz. There he died on 21 July 1884.<sup>364</sup> For an interval of 30 years we have now no reports of a mission. Further missions were held:

- 1915, by P. Anton Baselgia of Sumvitg, Jesuit.

- 1927, by the two Capuchin brothers, P. Placi and P. Teodosi Deragisch, of Tujetsch.

- 1939, by P. Teodosi Sialm, Jesuit, of Segnas.

- 1949, held by P. Tumasch Häberle, Benedictine of Mustér.

- 1960, held by the two Capuchin fathers Ehrenbert Kohler and Teofried Benz.

- 1980, from 9–16 May, by P. Ehrenbert Kohler.<sup>365</sup>


### 6. Confirmation

The entries in the parish confirmation register of the 17th century are not complete and those of the 18th appear to have been entered retroactively. In the year 1656 prince-bishop Gion Flugi d'Aspermont VI confirmed at Pleif a large number of confirmands from Cumbel, children and also adults. Besides the family names of Cumbel found today, the following still appear among the confirmands: Caglier, Cing (Tschegn), Donau, Peder, de Puoz and Gargieri.

On 30 June 1716, on the occasion of the consecration of the chapel of S. Murezi, bishop Duri de Federspiel confirmed at Cumbel 66 confirmands. On 20 June 1739, there was confirmation at Pleif and bishop Josef Benedikt von Rost confirmed 68 confirmands from Cumbel.

On 13 September 1744 the same bishop confirmed at Pleif 71 confirmands from Cumbel. And already two years later, on 19 July 1746, the papal nuncio with residence at Lucerna, mons. Filippo Acciajouli, confirmed at Cumbel 51 confirmands, among whom many from outside: from Degen, Vella, Vignogn, Peiden and from Morissen. The nuncio had namely undertaken a personal visitation of all the posts of the Rhaetian Mission in the course of July of that year.<sup>366</sup> For that purpose he had come to Cumbel.

On 1 September 1772 bishop Gion Antoni de Federspiel confirmed at Pleif 62 confirmands. On 9 September 1787 bishop Dionis von Rost confirmed 70. On 27 August 1804 bishop Carli Rudolf Buol-Schauenstein confirmed ca. 75. In 1807 the papal nuncio, Fabritius Scebera, confirmed at Sagogn ca. 15 confirmands from Cumbel. Further confirmations took place: 1819, 27 January (Buol), and 1832, 21 July (Buol). Bishop Caspar de Cari confirmed at Cumbel in July 1844 and in August 1855 at Pleif. Two years before, in 1853, he had already confirmed at Schluein ca. 30 children from Cumbel, among others, as was customary at that time, also small ones from one to nine years old. Bishop Franz Nicolaus Fiorentini confirmed in September 1865, Caspar Willi in June 1875, Franz Constantin Rampa in July 1884 and bishop Gion Fidel Battaglia in May 1890 and April 1896 and 1902, April, 1908 on 6 May. All confirmations were at Pleif, except 1716, 1746 and 1807 as cited above. From then on confirmations took place at Cumbel by bishop Georgius Schmid 1913, 1918, at Pleif 1923 and 1928. Since then only at Cumbel by bishop Luregn Mattias Vincenz 1933 and 1937, by bishop Cristian Caminada 1942, 1947, 1952, 1957, by bishop Johannes Vonderach 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977 and 1982.<sup>367</sup>


### 7. Church Choir

A church choir organized as an association apparently began around 1892. Before, there had been much discussion in the clerical chapters about the reorganization of church singing. Also the pastor, P. Nicolaus, had agitated somewhat. A communal assembly of 23 October 1892 then adopted the resolution: «to erect a permanent choir of singing, into which capable singers shall be admitted, without distinction whether they be young men or not. For this choir a suitable and sufficient space shall be reserved on the gallery, which shall be enclosed.»<sup>368</sup> In 1909 the «society of church singing», as the choir was then called, acquired a new harmonium and the parish assumed 100.– fr. as requested.<sup>369</sup> Around 1913 the question of a mixed choir was raised. They asked bishop Georgius Schmid for permission. He refused it, citing a certain papal decree of 18 January 1904 on church music. At that time there also reigned some discord over the space on the gallery.<sup>370</sup> In the year 1972 the choir constituted itself as a mixed choir. As such it sang in church for the first time at Christmas 1974.<sup>371</sup>



## VIII. Education

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-36.jpg" caption="The school, October 1899. P. Leonhard, beside him president Balzer Fidel Arpagaus, below the old Giachen Arpagaus, schoolmaster, and schoolmaster Gion Murezi Arpagaus" %}

### 1. The School

Shortly after the beginning of the 19th century the old school of the pastors and chaplains began to undergo a development that led it step by step away from the Church and into the hands of the state, that is, of the political commune under the aegis of cantonal authorities.<sup>372</sup> The Church had here, as in other spheres too, prepared the ground for the state.

In those «times of the beginning» the individual communes had begun to open school funds. School cost money. Until now the clergy had taught school, one can say, practically free of charge.<sup>373</sup> At Cumbel the Company of Christian Doctrine had functioned not badly.<sup>374</sup> The neighboring commune of Morissen had opened a school fund in 1846.<sup>375</sup> In 1851 the commune of Cumbel resolved that anyone who married a woman from outside the commune had to contribute 20.– fl. to the school fund.<sup>376</sup> In 1857 there came still more: «First, it is imposed on all neighbors who marry 5.– fr. for the school fund. 2. All those who die without descendants shall pay 2 per mille to the school fund.»<sup>377</sup> These provisions were then also incorporated into the communal constitution of 1862.<sup>378</sup> In 1872 the commune resolved, willingly or not, to give the school fund 200.– fr. from the alms fund (spenda).<sup>379</sup> All the same the commune worried about the financial burden. In 1853 the communal president reported to the department of education at Cuera that Cumbel possessed a school fund of 1760.– fr. and had made several provisions to augment it and hoped in view of such efforts to receive from the canton a premium, which was granted in such cases.<sup>380</sup> In 1855 P. Bonaventura repeated the request for a subsidy. The tax on foreign women marrying into the commune had been raised to 34.– fr. and every school child paid a school fee of 3.– fr. and this made attending school more odious than pleasant.<sup>381</sup> In 1877 the levy on the pupil was raised to 3.82 and in 1878 already to 4.– fr. and in 1879 to 4.30.<sup>382</sup> Beyond this the parents of pupils had yet another duty: that of preparing the school firewood. All the same they grew tired of it and in 1883 declared: «. . . that they would not prepare the firewood this year for the schoolmaster or for the school, but rather attribute that burden according to the communal law.» The communal assembly then decided: «The carting of the wood shall be done by the commune; the preparation of it shall be taken on by those who have school children.»<sup>383</sup> In 1885 the commune took over that work too.<sup>384</sup> But already in 1889 the commune resolved: «The preparation of the school firewood is provided by the parents of the children for two years.»<sup>385</sup> – The requests for a cantonal subsidy for the school followed thereafter regularly until well into the 1890s.<sup>386</sup>

Until the year 1891 there was only one school, then two and again only one and then a third, according to this overview:

| | |
|---|---|
| until 1891 | 1 school |
| 1891/92–1903/1904 | 2 schools |
| 1904/05 | 1 school |
| 1905/06–1939 | 2 schools |
| 1939/40–1946 | 3 schools |
| 1946/47–1953 | 2 schools |
| 1953/54 | 1 school |
| 1954/55–1963 | 2 schools |
| 1963/64 to the present (1982) one manual arts school and 2 primary schools. |
| 1971/72 merged with Morissen.<sup>387</sup> |


In 1908 a start was made with a so-called «advanced school» (scola da perfecziun).<sup>388</sup> In 1909 the commune resolved «to hold a repetition school, although a beginning had already been made in 1857, with the so-called «summer school» or «repetition school», as moreover also in other localities.<sup>390</sup> Schoolmaster Gion Giusep Cadieli took on that year the summer school for a salary of 2.– fr. per day.<sup>391</sup> The cantonal education council highly praised the efforts of the commune of Cumbel for education and especially for the summer school.<sup>392</sup> In 1891/92 and following years, repetition school was held with 5 hours per week, three on Thursday morning and two on Saturday afternoon.<sup>393</sup> In the report of 1903 there is also mention of a «voluntary supplementary school for girls», which had existed for several years.<sup>394</sup>

The school *lasted* at first 5 months, from the beginning of November to the end of March, in all 22 weeks; in 1867, 22 weeks for 9 years of schooling and 24 weeks for 8 years; in 1904 the duration was fixed by the canton at 26 weeks for 9 and 28 weeks for 8 years of schooling.<sup>395</sup>

The short school term was then rigorously observed. The *«going down to the Schwab»* (ir giul Schuob — seasonal labor migration to the Swabian lowlands) of its day gave the school councils some trouble. They had to ensure that school was not curtailed. In 1871 the education council obliged the school inspectors to report unauthorized cases.<sup>396</sup> On this matter the communal council received from Cuera in July 1878 a letter from the Small Council: «. . . From your letter of . . . we have thus ascertained that no fewer than 8 children received certificates and permission to leave school to go down to the Schwab before it ended. On the basis of the resolution of the Grand Council of 30 June 1871, you have incurred a penalty of 40.– fr. which is to be paid to the cantonal treasury within 15 days. In the name of the Small Council: the president, Fr. Conrad.»<sup>397</sup>

The school of a hundred and more years ago certainly followed the good maxim of achieving the most in the shortest time. Punctuality and discipline were also insisted upon. For the opening of school on 3 November 1863, for example, the school president «gave the particular notice that from that day on they should not let themselves be caught on the street making mischief, but that the places where they should keep themselves were namely the home, the church and the school<sup>398</sup>». The short school term was rigorously observed. If a holy day fell in that week, or even only a burial, there was to be no day off that week, by order of inspector Giohen Disch.<sup>399</sup> A good schoolmistress Ludivina Guetg must have been, the wife of the policeman or «Landjäger» Gion Antoni Guetg of Savognin. Inspector Disch praised her extraordinarily for her discipline and her success.<sup>400</sup> From the school visit of the school council of December 1884 it was remarked of her school: «They found themselves very satisfied, as much for the progress of the pupils as for the good discipline maintained in school, without receiving even the smallest complaint either from the schoolmistress or from the pupils.»<sup>401</sup>

The *examination* at the end of the school year was in those days held with some solemnity. One of the pupils gave a speech «in gratitude to the schoolmaster<sup>402</sup>». Quite moving is what the recorder reports of the examination of 1856: «A pupil gave a speech and thanked the schoolmaster and all pupils, weeping, bade farewell to and left their beloved schoolmaster» (G.G. Cadieli).<sup>403</sup> And about the examination of 1858 it is written: «Then the pupil Crest Tumasch Caduff, with short but all the more beautiful words, thanked the schoolmaster in the name of all his fellow pupils for the care employed in instilling in them knowledge united with virtue.»<sup>404</sup> In 1859 the school inspector P. Martin Andreoli OSB said at the end of his visit: «The school of Cumbel is the most advanced in progress.»<sup>405</sup>


### 2. The Schoolhouse

Until 1877 school was held in a room or hall adjoining the rectory house, built in 1840 for the school.<sup>406</sup> It counts as the first schoolhouse. After this room was vacated by the school, P. Bonaventura had several small rooms built above the hall, which served the fathers on the occasion of conferences and exercises. The commune had offered all the material free of charge and the father paid with his own money, resp. from the Mission, the workers, in all 300.– florins or 510.– fr.<sup>407</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-37.jpg" caption="The school 1904/05" %}

Already the communal assembly of 1 March 1872 had resolved to build a schoolhouse of its own.<sup>408</sup> With some delay, the education council in 1874 insisted on undertaking the work. The school council replied that it was underway.<sup>409</sup> In 1875 a new impetus came to execute the plan by obtaining a suitable plot. The protocol of the communal assembly of 13 April relates: «. . . the Commandant de Mont, with an act of goodwill toward the commune, has ceded now and forever his portion of land on which the barn of those Rigiet stood, in favor of the commune, so as to be able to build the schoolhouse and this for a counter-payment, of which nothing was discussed today.»<sup>410</sup> In 1876 they began building. On this the pastor of that time, P. Nicolaus, left a report, which we follow:

In January the timber was felled. In May and June the masters began. On that same site there stood an old, decrepit, abandoned house. The commune bought it for 500.– fr. The mason Giachen Bachin of Sagogn dug the foundation for 750.– fr. Giachen Fidel Cavelti of Sagogn did the carpentry for 2418.– fr. On 9 February the house was finished and on 11 February it could be taken into possession. The total costs, without the timber and the communal labor, amounted to 3668.– fr.

The inauguration celebration unfolded as follows: At 12:30 the small bell was rung to assemble the pupils in the old school and at the same time at the rectory house the school council, the school inspector Murezi Blumenthal of Surcasti, and the communal council with mistral Gion Gieri Arpagaus at the head. They proceeded «in all formality» to the schoolroom. P. Nicolaus, as president of the school council, declared in a short address the reason for the assembly. A pupil gave a short speech and thanked the old schoolhouse for its service during 37 years and invited the pupils to sing a song. Thereupon a procession formed; in front a boy with a small fluttering flag, followed by two boys who carried on two poles a fine May bouquet and the geographical map, followed by the other pupils and the girl pupils who carried «the chart of the new metric measure». Now came the schoolmaster, the school councillors, the pastor with the school inspector, young men and young women, and last the communal council with the mistral, followed by a large crowd. The festive procession took the path through the cemetery, down to the square of the post office «and slowly took position before the door of the new schoolhouse which inside was pompously decorated and outside adorned with two fine and well-formed arches». The closed door was opened, «but before entering the pastor blessed it solemnly». Then the procession entered and everyone took their place. A song of the pupils followed and the communal president read his speech. The mixed choir sang a song under the direction of schoolmaster Albin. Several speakers took the floor: the inspector, the father, communal and school councillors and last schoolmaster Albin. After a song by the mixed choir the communal president spoke once more. To conclude the celebration the pupils went to the old school where the school council served them a «communal biscuit and a glass of wine<sup>411</sup>».

After 40 years, in 1917/18, the house was renovated and enlarged by building out the upper story, following plans by architect Risch Coray of Laax (Lags) and at a cost of 11 200.– fr.<sup>412</sup>

Already soon in the 1940s there was much talk of a new schoolhouse. Inspector and school council urged. In 1945 a petition with 21 signatures from parents arrived at the school council, requesting a new schoolhouse. Even though the rooms were heated morning and evening, the children often had to sit at zero degrees of cold.<sup>413</sup> The matter was urgent and ripe. Regarding the site and the design of the house there were, however, many divergences and difficulties to overcome. In the end they decided on the site of the old house. With architect Coray of Glion and consultation with cantonal architect A. Willi they went to work. In the spring of 1947 the old house was demolished. In 1947/48 school was held in private houses. In the autumn of 1948 the school year could begin in the new house. The inauguration took place on 30 October 1948. The total costs amounted to 154 000.– fr. In 1959 the school playground in the Val Caparli was arranged.<sup>414</sup> On the western façade of the house the painter Huber of Pfäffikon painted S. Murezi on horseback.<sup>415</sup>


### 3. The Schoolmasters

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-38.jpg" caption="The school 1908/09. From left to right: Schoolmaster Gion Murezi Arpagaus, Mistral Giachen Cavegn of Vella, P. Urban, district president Balzer Fidel Arpagaus and school councillor Resi Martin Caduff" %}

The *election of the schoolmasters* underwent many changes. At first they were elected by the communal assembly. In 1879 the commune decided to «delegate the appointment of the schoolmaster to the school council<sup>416</sup>». But already on 17 September 1882 «the resp. neighbors have of themselves chosen the schoolteacher Giachen Arpagaus of Cumbel, instead of the school council as heretofore, and this under the clear condition that the neighbors should have the right of election or the right to choose the schoolmaster henceforth<sup>417</sup>». The communal constitution of 1891 specifies: «The election of the school personnel is reserved to the communal assembly; the school council has to take information and to bring a recommendation to the commune.»<sup>418</sup> In 1908 the schoolmasters at Cumbel had demanded by a petition to the commune that the schoolmasters should be elected by the school council. The school council was not opposed but demanded that the council be augmented from three to five members. The assembly of 1 March decided that augmentation and that the schoolmasters should, according to cantonal regulations, be elected by the school council.<sup>419</sup> Nevertheless, in 1954 the commune once again resolved by 50 against 5 votes to elect the schoolmasters itself.<sup>420</sup> The cantonal school law of 1961 fixed the election by a body outside the communal assembly. For Cumbel this is the school council together with the communal council.

Precious as the schoolmaster was, his *pay* was never greater than that of a sacristan (signun). In 1854: «engaged a schoolmaster for 136.– fr.» School then lasted 5 months, from the beginning of November to the beginning of April. For the following years we have these rates for the schoolmasters' pay:

| | |
|---|---|
| 1855/56 | 187.– fr. |  
| 1856/57 | 180.– fr. |  
| 1857/58 | 187.– fr. |  
| 1858/59 | 200.– fr. |  
| 1859/60 | 200.– fr. |
| 1863/64 | 210.– fr. |
| 1867/68 | 300.– fr. |
| 1872/73 | 310.– fr. |
| 1873/74 | 340.– fr. |
| 1874/75 | 360.– fr. |
| 1876/77 | 375.– fr. |
| 1878/79 | 390.– fr. |

From 1879 to 1883 schoolmaster Giachen Arpagaus taught school again for only 340.– fr. per year. And schoolmistress Ludivina Guetg taught school from 1885–1889 also for only that pay and two loads of firewood per year, thus five years for 1700.– fr. In 1890 schoolmaster Gion Rudolf Collenberg took on the entire school with 51 pupils for a pay of 400.– fr.»<sup>421</sup> This too is an image of the times: In 1897 the young schoolmaster Gion Murezi Arpagaus applied for the upper school, for 340.– fr. So as not to lose his position, schoolmaster Rud. Collenberg also went down from 400.– to 340.– fr. in pay. The department of education, however, gave the advice to refrain from such «practices, unworthy of a schoolmaster».<sup>422</sup>

## IX. Social Matters

### 1. Poor Relief

#### a) Poor People

In those years there were many poor people among us. Of those, whom nobody cared about. Especially if they were foreigners, like that «Frenchman», as they called him, who had lived at Cumbel and in the surroundings for 20 years by begging and whom they then found dead in a barn in the vicinity of the village and buried on 11 November 1772.<sup>427</sup> On 30 January 1818 an Anna Maria Collenberg from here died while going for alms beyond Luven.<sup>428</sup> In 1835 a beggar from Rueun died at Cumbel, 72 years old.<sup>429</sup> In 1837 the father again buried a poor foreign beggar woman who went begging.<sup>430</sup> On 16 December 1839 they found a woman A.M.C. of Cumbel, who had returned from begging outside, half dead, in the forest of Cumbel. She died soon after.<sup>431</sup> In 1841 they again found a poor boy of 16, Gion Paul C., dead in a barn near the village.<sup>432</sup> In 1899 they found a certain M.M. C. of Cumbel, who went begging, at Scharons in a hayloft.<sup>433</sup> — Beggars were not exactly welcome, could often truly be a nuisance, and thus one understands the provision of the communal assembly of 1 March 1897: «Since the nuisance of beggars grows ever greater and they cause continuous disturbances by day and by night, the commune resolves to fine anyone who lodges such people in barns or haylofts 5.– fr.»<sup>434</sup>


#### b) The Alms Fund (spenda)

For the support of the poor there existed, as also in other localities, the so-called spenda (alms fund).<sup>435</sup> This institution was born in the bosom of the Church and became established within that body. In the 17th century the bishop, on the occasion of his confirmation visits, took stock of the alms fund assets and the wardens (ugaus) rendered account to the bishop.<sup>436</sup> With the alms fund there were also united founded masses («perpetual» masses). One handed over to this fund the capital for masses with the obligation that the alms fund have them celebrated annually.<sup>437</sup> The alms fund wardens were elected together with the church and benefice wardens and with the other communal officials by the communal assembly, until the separation of parish and political commune.

Gradually, however, the alms fund slipped into the hands of the political commune. Already the communal law of 1862 treats poor relief as a matter of the political commune: «Art. 40. The poor relief commission, ordinarily consisting of two members, administers the assets of the alms fund and ensures that it is not diminished. Art. 41. Once a year, in December, it takes up the number of the poor who are entitled to the alms fund. This list must be approved by the council. Art. 42. It fixes the quantum of alms that each is to receive, according to his needs and his financial resources. Art. 43. It keeps accounts of what is received and disbursed, whether money or victuals. The wardens draw their pay for ordinary expenses.»<sup>438</sup> In 1896 the commune expressly regarded the alms fund as its own domain, as its secretary declares: «Since the alms fund is a totally political institution and is not included in the annual official reports on poor relief, it is appropriate to incorporate the capital for perpetual masses into the church fund. Whoever wishes to make donations and combine with them the obligation of a perpetual mass, should be directed to the church or benefice administration.»<sup>439</sup> One year later, in 1897, 30 perpetual masses were incorporated in the alms fund with a capital of 2121.– fr. This was, on 11 November, taken from the alms fund and incorporated into the perpetual mass fund of the church.<sup>440</sup> But already in 1875 Dr. Gion Barclamiu Arpagaus had petitioned the government at Cuera — and not the episcopal curia — to take a certain sum from the alms fund for certain communal purposes<sup>441</sup>, only to receive a negative reply: such an alienation «would contravene the law of 1 January 1849». Cumbel still had a good number of poor people and it was not appropriate to reduce the poor relief fund.<sup>442</sup>

Around 1890 the alms fund possessed several plots of land (Ulezis): Frust Sut, Frust sura Clius, Crucifix sut via, a plot at Crucifix sper via sur vart, a plot at Crucifix sissum, three plots at Rueun oradem, enamiez and entadem. The capital of the alms fund then yielded an annual interest of 722.– fr.<sup>443</sup> The alms fund also possessed alpine rights, at Val, at Leis, leased out in 1883 for 56.– fr. and at Selva for 42.– fr.<sup>444</sup> When in 1942 it was proposed at the communal assembly to sell Leis, «it will fetch a good price», this was refused with the remark that they «had made bad deals selling alps<sup>445</sup>».

Among the obligations of the alms fund one also heard of distributing to the poor bread, flour and salt on All Saints' Day, St. Brigid's Day, the Rogation Days and St. John's Day.<sup>446</sup> According to a list covering 1845 to 1893, year by year on Good Friday between 70 and 100 pounds of bread were distributed.<sup>447</sup>

Where the alms fund did not suffice and nobody was prepared to take a pauper to board (dunsena), the poor were sent around in rotation for meals at the individual families and this «in proportion to the cantonal tax assessment». In 1871 for example two from Cumbel, S. C. and A. C., went for meals in rotation.<sup>448</sup> To have some order, the communal assembly of 1 March 1887 resolved the following:

«Concerning the alimentation of the poor, in particular the C. brothers, the commune resolves to do this by sending them around in rotation, namely according to the rule that for every 2000.– fr. one is to keep them one day, and whoever possesses only 1000.–, every other turn. Every citizen who is on the tax roll is obliged to keep the poor or to arrange that someone keeps them for him, and those who are not domiciled here shall pay for every day they would be obliged to keep the poor a compensation of, for every 2000.– fr., 50 centimes into the communal treasury. The overseer of the poor going in rotation, at present Balzer Collenberg, with an annual pay of 10.– fr.»<sup>449</sup>

In 1894 it was added: «Whoever cannot keep them due to family circumstances must pay 1 fr. for each.»<sup>450</sup> Still in 1903 there was discussion about sending the poor around in rotation.<sup>451</sup> The manner in which the poor were sent around in rotation is best illustrated by the roster of 1887. This is interesting also because it gives a picture of the families of Cumbel a hundred years ago and of their economic situation, as follows: *«Regulations for the two paupers who go in rotation.* For every 2000.– fr. of assets one is to give one day's meals to each of these two paupers. For the hundreds in excess of the thousands, 4 centimes per hundred each turn. Begun with the Big Italian (Talianer Grond) at Gieri Caduff sper fontauna on 9 March 1887, with the Small Italian (Talianer Pign) at widow Onna Maria Arpagaus on 9 March 1887.»

*Poorhouse (casa pauperila).* In 1907 the audit commission made the proposal to sell or demolish the poorhouse; it was hardly habitable any more. The discussion was deferred.<sup>453</sup> On 1 March 1909 it was resolved: «The poorhouse is to be demolished. The usable timber reserved for the commune, the rest to be auctioned.»<sup>454</sup> An assembly of January 1910 noted the liquidation of the poorhouse. Before the demolition it had been appraised at 800.– fr.<sup>455</sup> In 1921 the commune resolved to auction also the site of the poorhouse.<sup>456</sup> – In the 1930s the commune purchased another house, and in 1946 the commune resolved to renovate it at a cost of 6500.– fr.<sup>457</sup>


#### c) The Small Alms Fund (spenda pintga)

Besides the alms fund there existed at Cumbel since 1769 a so-called «spenda pintga» (small alms fund), also called «private alms fund» or «spenda da sur Gieri» (alms fund of sur Gieri), a foundation of a rather private character. The cleric Dr. Gieri Arpagaus, of Cumbel and Sursaissa<sup>458</sup>, in his last years chaplain at Uors, had under the date of 16 April 1769 at Uors bequeathed by testament a sum for the poor, in the first instance from his kinship, should they ever come into need of help. Six days later, on 22 April, he died and was buried at Cumbel in the church.<sup>459</sup> To his two or three cousins at Cumbel he entrusted the administration. The capital must not be diminished. To be able to make use of the interest, however, the needy had to be resident in Surselva.<sup>460</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-40.jpg" caption="The new old people's home" %}

The capital of the spenda pintga amounted in the year 1847 to 1163.– florins, in 1862 it was 1986.– fr., in 1893 2222.– fr. and in the year 1904 the capital had grown to 2456.– fr. Additionally it had 1½ alpine rights at Leis and one alpine right at Selva.<sup>461</sup>

The testator had, however, also left it to his heirs of this fund to give it «another form», if one did not wish to use the word «alms fund», but the purpose of the foundation had to be maintained.

The spenda pintga previously possessed an account book with some interesting notes, which has regrettably been lost. The accounts were closed each time on Good Friday. That day the poor in question received alms, earlier in kind and later in money. Administrators have been:

Dr. Gion Barclamiu Arpagaus, †1882. Schoolmaster Giachen Arpagaus, †1920. Gion Giachen Caduff 1920–1938. Balzer Antoni Arpagaus from 1938 until his death 1977. During his administration he helped in some cases with small amounts in the sense of the testament. Since his death his son Rest Gieri Arpagaus-Cabalzar administers the matter.<sup>462</sup> In 1939 a communal assembly had resolved «to place the two funds under one administration while keeping separate accounts<sup>463</sup>». But on 1 March 1941 the commune then specified: «The spenda pintga is to be a thing in itself, as of old, resolved unanimously.»<sup>464</sup>


### 2. Emigration

Who does not know the song of the emigrant by Alfons Tuor: Ti vul la patria bandunar, ti vul egl jester ir . . .! (You wish to leave the homeland, you wish to go abroad . . .!) It was sometimes the spirit of adventure that drove our people, numerous individuals and entire families, to foreign lands. Most were compelled to leave their narrow homeland and its meager turf, whether in military emigration as mercenaries, or as commercial emigrants: merchants, craftsmen, innkeepers and businesspeople. Many rose to prominence and even engaged in high politics in foreign lands, while others were less fortunate. An idea of the great emigration from our village is offered by the following list of names of those I have found in the parish registers. The list can hardly be complete. Not always were all those who died in foreign lands reported to the parish office.

#### c) From the parish registers

- b = from the baptismal registers

- m = from the death registers

- l = from the marriage registers

- r = the family name appears repeatedly thereafter

- rr = the family name recurs very frequently thereafter.

The baptismal, death and marriage registers of the parish contain a great number of family names now vanished or no longer existing in the commune. Sometimes the entries are somewhat unclear and here and there the true family name appears to be missing, for example 1653 16 April Jon Hans b, or 1656 13 March Martin Peder b.

The majority of the following family names appear repeatedly and some even very frequently. The individual family names are cited here only once, namely with the *first* entry found in the parish registers.

### 2. The Existing Family Names

The family names living today in the parish appear in the parish registers already in the 17th century, namely: Caduff, Arpagaus, Casanova, Cabalzar, Vieli, Collenberg and Cavegn. The following sequence says nothing about the antiquity of the family names, only when they first appear in the parish registers. Those begin in 1650. Abbreviations as in the preceding article.

### 3. Some Statistics

From the parish confirmation registers of the years 1658, 1716, 1744, 1772 and 1844 we ascertain the dominant family names for those years. On 31 August 1658, prince-bishop Johannes Flugi d'Aspermont confirmed at Pleif a large number of children and also adults. From Cumbel the following family names appear: Arpagaus, Caduff, Vieli, Caglier, Donau, Peder, Cing (= Tschegn = Vintschegn), Collenberg, Depuoz, Cavegn, Casanova, Gargieri and Balzer.

On 30 June 1716 bishop Duri de Federspiel consecrated the chapel of S. Murezi and confirmed at Cumbel 66 confirmands with the family names: Arpagaus, Caduff, Collenberg, Vieli, Cabalzar, Depuoz, Casanova and Caduin, which is probably a misspelling by the Italian father for Cavegn. Additionally Meister Gioder from Savoy.

On 3 September 1744 bishop Josephus Benedictus von Rost confirmed at Pleif 71 children from Cumbel with the family names: Caduff, Arpagaus, Collenberg, Vieli, Cabalzar, Cavegn and Casanova.

On 1 September 1772 the bishop of Cuera Johann Anton de Federspiel confirmed at Pleif 62 children from Cumbel, bearers of the family names: Caduff, Arpagaus, Cavegn, Casanova, Vieli, Collenberg and Cabalzar.

On 22 July 1844 the diocesan bishop Caspar de Cari confirmed at Pleif 71 children from Cumbel between the ages of 16 days and 11 years, of the family names: Arpagaus, Caduff, Cabalzar, Collenberg, Casanova, Derungs, Elvedi, Cavegn, Derungs and Gamboni (1 child).<sup>475</sup>

No less interesting is the statistics of family names from a hundred years ago, from the year 1884, recorded in the parish register of 1856–1875, under the title: Registro di tutti i vicini (Register of all citizens). It appears as follows:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| 1. | Total number of citizens of Cumbel living, enumerated in this census made anno 1884, including at home and abroad, total | 435 souls |
| 2. | Emigrants living abroad (exterior) | 36 souls |
|  | Abroad in Switzerland | 57 souls |
|  |  | — |
|  | Total abroad | 93 souls |
|  | Inhabitants at Cumbel | 342 souls<sup>476</sup> |


These 435 citizens or inhabitants of Cumbel are distributed among the family names:

| | |
|---|---|
| Arpagaus | 150 |
| Vieli | 11 |
| Caduff | 101 |
| Stoffel | 10 |
| Elvedi | 53 |
| Ahr | 4 |
| Collenberg | 30 |
| Furger | 4 |
| Derungs | 21 |
| Blumenthal | 3 |
| Casanova | 19 |
| Cabalzar | 3 |
| Cavegn | 18 |

With only *one* person the following family names still appear: Capaul, Capeder, Demont, Alig, Pajarola, Projer, Schlosser, Kleiber, Camenisch, Augustin and Kaelin. These 10 persons were perhaps only incidentally and briefly settled in the commune. For married women the husband's family is counted. This is not always possible, however, as for example the entry: Marionna Kleiber, wife of Gion Tambur.<sup>477</sup>


### 4. Elvedi

The family name Elvedi originates from Kecskemét in the Comitat Bács-Kiskun in Hungary. The market town is easily found on the map ca. 65 km south-east of Budapest. The family name was written Oelvedi. At Kecskemét there lived a «pastor» Ambros Oelvedi, who died in 1770. Beyond this it was not possible to ascertain anything from the state archive of that comitat because the archive buildings were being restored and everything was closed.<sup>478</sup> The first Elvedi who arrived at Cumbel some 180 years ago was called Josef Antoni. His eldest son, Gion Gieri, born 1800 and died on 5 March 1883, recounted several times the origin of the family to the then pastor of Cumbel, father Nicolaus d'Alessandria (at Cumbel 1871–1895). The latter then set this down in writing in 1880/81 and added a declaration of authenticity in 1882. The father inserted the account in the family register of the parish.<sup>479</sup> And I cannot do otherwise than let the description follow here word for word, but with a few small stylistic alterations here and there:

Faithful description of the origin of the Elvedi family name in this commune of Cumbel from ca. the year 1795. Progenitor: Josef Anton Elvedi. Around 1795, during the Napoleonic Wars, from which many soldiers deserted to save their lives, there appeared at Cumbel a certain Josef Anton Elvedi, having deserted from the Prussian or Austrian militia. He was born in Hungary at Cescheme \[Kecskemét\]. By the local people he was called «the Bohemian» (il Böhmisch). By staying some days in this commune he unexpectedly experienced the great particular goodwill of the people «beyond the cordial hospitality extended to him». Thus he resolved to choose Cumbel as the place of his provisional stay, at least as long as the wars should last. After two or three years he married one Maria Ursula Collenberg of Cumbel. Afterwards he moved to «Prussian Breslau» to earn a somewhat better living. There he had three children. The first was Gion Gieri, born 1800, the second Stefan Martin, born 1 May 1802, and the third Maria Anna Lisabet, born 24 August 1804. After 6–8 years in that place, he returned, at his wife's wish, to Cumbel with his family, ca. 1805/06. After a short time, finding himself very straitened in his finances, he resolved to make a journey to his homeland, to visit his relatives, but principally to try to obtain something of his paternal property. This he did, however, with great alarm, for fear of being seized by the police and imprisoned, as was done with deserters in wartime. He wished to hazard it. Before setting out on his journey he told his wife that he hoped to be back at Cumbel before long. In any event, however, should something unfavorable happen — being caught by the police — he promised to write or have a letter written to her.

After three or four weeks had passed without his appearing, the wife began to fear and «took notice»; one Sunday, when it happened to be just time to go to mass, a letter arrived for the wife, coming from Hungary. The woman, seized more than ever by fear and anguish, dared not break it open to read before going to mass; but she placed it on the table, locked the three small children in the house and with eyes full of tears went to mass.

The children, getting into mischief, took the letter and tore it up in such a manner that it was impossible to make out a single word of that letter. — Yet, Sep Elvedi never returned and it was not possible to obtain any news of him.

The unfortunate mother had to manage as best she could with those three small children. Gion Gieri went «to the land of the Schwab» (ella tiara dil Zuob). After some years he returned to his mother, worked a few years as a baker and then learned the trade of peddler (calgêr). With the trade he wished to begin selling «something such as needles, thread, tinsel, shoelaces and other similar little things». But through his industriousness, activity and thrift, he was able to put together in a few years a tidy sum.

In the year 1823 he married Orina Maria Arpagaus of Cumbel. They had four children. In the year 1830, on 13 April, he bought himself in as a citizen of Cumbel and «from then on the Elvedi family name began to become a citizenry of Cumbel».

«Declaration of the writer

The description of the Elvedis made here, which has its origin in one Sep Antoni Elvedi, is the precise account given personally and orally by the first-born Gion Gieri Elvedi a couple of times to me in this room around 1880/81 and set down in writing by me.

Cumbel 1882, father Nicolaus, pastor.»



## XI. Demographic Survey

### 1. Growth and Decline of the Population

To ascertain the number of the population of our parish, for the 17th century any census is lacking and only in 1772 did the father count and record a number of 256 souls.<sup>480</sup> The following censuses show our village had:

| | |
|---|---|
| 1803 | 360 souls | 
| 1835 | 377 souls |  
| 1850 | 278 souls<sup>481</sup> |  
| 1870 | 304 souls |  
| 1880 | 307 souls |  
| 1888 | 331 souls | 
| 1900 | 342 souls |
| 1910 | 275 souls |
| 1920 | 280 souls |
| 1930 | 304 souls |
| 1941 | 331 souls |
| 1950 | 298 souls |
| 1960 | 296 souls<sup>482</sup> |
| 1970 | 291 souls |
| 1980 | 268 souls<sup>483</sup> |

The decrease of 23 persons since 1970 is to be attributed to the fact that in the 1980 census those workers who worked during the week outside the commune were not counted. Additionally the number of children has decreased since 1970. – On the occasion of the visitation by the prefect of the Rhaetian Mission in 1858, the number of inhabitants at Cumbel is given as 380, «without ca. 20 persons abroad<sup>484</sup>». – A «status animarum» by P. Nicolaus from 1884 gives the following picture: Total number of living citizens 435. Of these, outside in Switzerland 57, abroad 36, inhabitants at Cumbel 342.<sup>485</sup>

From 1653–1715, thus in 62 years, 507 children were baptized<sup>486</sup>, that is approximately 8 per year. In the same period there were only 357 funerals, however without counting the «small funerals» (baras pintgas — child burials) from ca. 1690 to ca. 1730, which were not even registered.<sup>487</sup> This would amount to a great increase of the population, had there not prevailed from that time well into our century an enormous *infant mortality*. The following statistics speak sufficiently of that calamity:

| | |
|---|---|
| 1653–1663 | 52 adult funerals and 31 child burials |
| 1663–1674 | 49 adult funerals and 26 child burials |
| 1675–1680 | 32 adult funerals and 13 child burials |
| 1681–1690 | 39 adult funerals and 16 child burials |
| 1691–1730 | child burials not registered |
| 1731–1740 | 51 adult funerals and 32 child burials |
| 1741–1750 | 40 adult funerals and 51 child burials |
| 1751–1760 | 49 adult funerals and 37 child burials |
| 1761–1770 | 71 adult funerals and 49 child burials |
| 1771–1780 | 55 adult funerals and 48 child burials |
| 1781–1790 | 45 adult funerals and 43 child burials |
| 1791–1800 | 53 adult funerals and 30 child burials |
| 1801–1810 | 48 adult funerals and 27 child burials |
| 1811–1820 | 57 adult funerals and 44 child burials |
| 1821–1830 | 33 adult funerals and 53 child burials |
| 1831–1840 | 55 adult funerals and 23 child burials |
| 1841–1850 | 53 adult funerals and 41 child burials |
| 1851–1860 | 75 adult funerals and 34 child burials |
| 1861–1870 | 52 adult funerals and 41 child burials |
| 1881–1890 | 52 adult funerals and 27 child burials |
| 1891–1900 | 69 adult funerals and 25 child burials |
| 1901–1910 | 65 adult funerals and 17 child burials |
| 1911–1920 | 49 adult funerals and 8 child burials |
| 1921–1930 | 53 adult funerals and 13 child burials |
| 1931–1940 | 41 adult funerals and 12 child burials |
| 1941–1950 | 31 adult funerals and 4 child burials |
| 1951–1960 | 33 adult funerals and 4 child burials |
| 1961–1970 | 32 adult funerals and 3 child burials |
| 1971–1977 | 23 adult funerals and 0 child burials |


The infant mortality was appalling. Approximately a third of those born died in childhood. They accepted all the children. There was no family planning in today's sense. Mortality regulated everything. And they consoled themselves with having an «angel» in paradise. A conception which the father expressed with his entry for a child burial in 1771: «Yesterday a little boy of 4 years flew away to the kingdom promised to the little ones.»<sup>488</sup>

As a consequence, the *midwives* (spinderas) had the obligation to be instructed in emergency baptism. Already bishop Duri de Federspiel VII had demanded in his «Ordinances» on the occasion of confirmation visits from 1695 «that every locality should have a sufficient number of midwives, pious, God-fearing and well instructed by the pastor in emergency baptism and that they should take the oath<sup>489</sup>». Bishop Gion Antoni de Federspiel had similarly ordained in the year 1760.<sup>490</sup> On his pastoral and confirmation visits the bishop constantly inquired after the adequate instruction of the midwives.<sup>491</sup> Despite everything, the pastors did not trust in all cases. Therefore the father at Cumbel remarks in the baptismal register of 1750 that the chapter had resolved that children baptized by midwives should afterwards be baptized «conditionally» in church.<sup>492</sup> Conditionally by the priest were also baptized those children who had been baptized by the midwife, on account of danger of death, even before delivery. This happened not infrequently, for example three times in the year 1761.<sup>493</sup>

Around 1910 infant mortality began visibly to cease, declining until it practically disappeared entirely in the 1970s. This applied of course in general and not only for the parish of Cumbel.

Mention must also be made of the calamity of *childbearing women* (piglialauncas). Many died in childbed without the help of a physician. Therefore they received before giving birth the holy sacraments and besought the blessing of the priest.<sup>494</sup> The cases of death in childbirth are not all recorded – but those that are entered were: 1653, 1655, 1658, 1677, 1722, 1766, 1770, 1779, 1816, 1819, 1823, 1825, 1827, 1839, 1870, 1883.<sup>495</sup>


### 2. Age and Other Statistics

Since the parish death registers also contain the age of those entered, the years that our forebears attained can be ascertained. They were a good deal fewer than today, as everyone can convince themselves by comparing the following lists. And this is all the more striking if one considers that here it is a matter *only of adults*, of «communicants», and that ca. a third of those born had already died as children up to 12–14 years. In the following lists, to simplify, only the completed years of the deceased are taken. The months are omitted. In some cases the father also entered only «circa» such and such years.


Decade 1751–1760.

Years: 60, 60, 31, 66, 24, 62, 19, 96, 66, 40, 64, 25, 25, 52, 81, 64, 15, 53, 39, 63, 84, 60, 55, 64, 68, 61, 21, 40, 45, 52, 68, 55, 16, 63, 26, 62, 61, 50, 39, 40, 43, 15, 81, 70, 63, 69, 72, 23, 53.

These 49 persons, born in that decade and who lived past 15 years – and that is only about two thirds – attained on average an age of only 51½ years.


Decade 1791–1800.

Years: 68, 50, 75, 56, 66, 47, 40, 57, 60, 50, 66, 75, 50, 78, 50, 55, 83, 60, 40, 44, 79, 83, 60, 53, 63, 75, 62, 60, 55, 55, 64, 55, 56, 41, 59, 69, 67, 46, 32, 64, 69, 21, 45, 22, 47, 28, 30, 17, 60, 52, 58, 58.

Average: 55¼ years.


Decade 1851–1860.

Years: 64, 69, 65, 84, 70, 64, 33, 26, 68, 28, 64, 37, 63, 73, 22, 56, 30, 74, 25, 63, 74, 73, 45, 61, 65, 68, 76, 23, 73, 26, 93, 78, 33, 73, 73, 82, 63, 75, 60, 16, 50, 64, 47, 24, 79, 35, 28, 60, 50, 26, 25, 54, 69, 23, 22, 51, 68, 17, 43, 75, 25, 52, 61, 74, 57, 83, 79, 54.

Average: 61¼. Life expectancy had begun to rise.


Decade 1941–1950.

Years: 85, 56, 65, 61, 78, 87, 23, 70, 73, 73, 52, 90, 50, 72, 62, 61, 80, 69, 51, 70, 72, 61, 23, 46, 46, 77, 82, 74, 30, 53, 73, 61.

Average: 63⅓. Life expectancy had risen, infant mortality ceased.


The years 1971–1977.

Years: 87, 77, 84, 45, 43, 87, 87, 86, 82, 85, 72, 96, 48, 97, 69, 45, 82, 80, 89, 85, 80, 87, 82.

Average: 77⅙. Life expectancy had risen greatly, infant mortality vanished.<sup>496</sup>


Around 1830 the parish death registers began also to indicate the *illness* of the dying, for example in the three years 1838–1840 the following died of: Bronchitis 2, Phthisis 1, Pleuritis 5, debility (fleivlezia) 3, antronimia 1, dysentery 1, apoplexy (daguota) 1, childbirth (pigliola) 1, dropsy (hidropisis) 1.

The illnesses recorded for the deceased of 1901–1910 are: Phthisis 9, dropsy 8, old age 8, apoplexy 7, cancer 6, malcostas 5, diphtheria 2, typhus 1, «jaundice» (itterizia) 1, «hernia» (ernia) 1, meningitis 1, sudden death (mort anetga) 1, madernatscha 1, facial erysipelas (rosabella) 1.<sup>497</sup>


At what age did our forebears of a hundred years ago *marry?* Mostly at a somewhat more advanced age than later. Let us examine a statistic from 1840–1875 (v = widower, widow):


| groom age | bride age | | groom age | bride age | | groom age | bride age | | groom age | bride age | | groom age | bride age |

*Marriage statistics:*

| | |
|---|---|
| 85 men married at an average age of | 32⅓ years |
| 85 women married at an average age of | 29½ years |


Subtracting the widowers from the above statistics yields:

| | |
|---|---|
| 7 widowers remarried at an average age of | 44¾ years |
| for the remaining 78 men the average is | 31¼ years |
| 4 widows remarried at an average age of | 40 years |
| for the remaining brides the average is | 29 years |


Also *consanguinity* (ingeneraziun) plays a role, especially in smaller and isolated localities. In those 35 years, 1840–1875, 9 couples married in the 2nd degree of kinship and about as many in the 3rd and 4th degree, naturally with ecclesiastical dispensation. During the following 25 years, from 1876–1900, only two couples married in the 2nd degree of kinship, but in the 3rd and 4th degree somewhat more. For the interval 1940–1978 only 3 marriages in the 3rd degree of kinship are registered.<sup>498</sup>

The cultural historian of the Grisons, Johann Andreas von Sprecher, asserts in his «Cultural History of the Three Leagues in the 18th Century» that the number of *illegitimate births* in the Grisons was still minimal in comparison with other lands and even with other cantons of Switzerland.<sup>499</sup> This praise applied in quite special measure to our village at the entrance of the Lumnezia. From the moment the baptismal registers begin in 1653, we find not a single illegitimate birth during nearly a hundred years until 1751. And in 1808 a second follows and in 1813 a third. Other cases, mostly of foreign persons or transient residents, follow: 1822, 1842, 1857 (2), 1869, 1879, 1880, 1881 (2), 1884, 1895 (2), 1897 (2), 1901, 1903, 1906 (2), 1909, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1920 . . .<sup>500</sup>, proportions observed to be approximately the same also in other Sursilvan and Surmeiran localities.

*Confessionally* Cumbel has always remained exclusively Catholic, with the exception of here and there a resident, mostly for a short time. Protestant women who married into Cumbel preferred to convert. We find at least 4 *converts:*

- 1658, on 4 April, a child of Gion Donau and of Stina, a new convert from Castrisch, was baptized.

- 1658, on 13 September, Maria, daughter of Durisch Conrau of Rumein and of his wife Barla, a new convert, was baptized.

- 1815, on 15 July, Monica Gabriel of Vuorz, 21 years old, was baptized conditionally, after having renounced «heresy» before the necessary witnesses, and received Holy Communion in the presence of cathedral provost Rud. de Blumenthal and the pastor of Pleif, Giachen Camen, as sponsors.

- 1849, on 24 August, Turtè Seeli of Flims (Flem), Protestant, converted.<sup>501</sup>


### 3. The Men-at-Arms 1799

It was during the war of the French, 1799. The French generalissimo Masséna, commander-in-chief of the armies of Helvetic occupation, made in March the general attack on the Grisons. On 7 March the French divisions poured across our borders: over the Alpsu, over the Lukmanier, up the Rhine valley, and over the Cunelas, coming from the Ticino and from the Val Mesolcina. Effective resistance was offered only by the Cadi. This with an initial good success. After the victorious battle on the meadow of Cons at Mustér, the troops of sub-general Loison were repulsed and driven back into Tujetsch and over the Oberalp (Cuolm d'Ursera). However, French troops had penetrated from the north and from the south into the country and General Demont (of Vella) had come over the Cunelas to La Punt and from Surselva southward with his detachment. The Cadi had to capitulate and on 14 March already the entire canton of the Grisons was occupied and under French arms. At the same moment the Grisons came under a French puppet government (Bavier). This immediately issued a proclamation with the order that all men capable of bearing arms were to immediately surrender all weapons of war.<sup>502</sup> The proclamation bears the date of 20 March 1799 and in consequence the following men of Cumbel had to hand over their arms, as follows:

- Mistral Murezi Benedetg Arpagaus, 2 rifles (buis) («2 guers»)

- Balzer Fidel Arpagaus, three rifles and two bayonets

- Martin Antoni Arpagaus, two rifles and one bayonet

- Sexton (scarvon) Crest Gieri Arpagaus, one rifle and one bayonet

- Francestg Caspar Collenberg, one rifle and one bayonet

- Giusep Arpagaus, one rifle and one bayonet

- Crest Andriu Arpagaus, one rifle and «in tegien» (= Degen = sword)

- Caspar Antoni Cabalzar, three rifles and two swords

- Gion Zamun (= Tschamun) Casanova, one rifle, one bayonet and one sword

- Gion Simon Vieli, two rifles

- Gion Giuchin Caduff, three rifles and one bayonet

- Children of Crest Antoni Arpagaus, three rifles

- Luzi Antoni Arpagaus, one rifle and one bayonet

- Giachen Antoni Collenberg, two rifles and one bayonet

- Crest Murezi Arpagaus, one rifle and one bayonet

- Benedetg Arpagaus, one rifle and one bayonet

- Balzer Antoni Arpagaus, two rifles and one bayonet

- Sievi Antoni Arpagaus, one rifle and one bayonet

- Murezi Antoni Caduff, two rifles, one bayonet and one sword

- Hasper Martin Caduff, one rifle and one bayonet

- Sexton (scarvon) Giachen Arpagaus, one rifle and one bayonet

- Crest Cabalzar, two rifles and one bayonet

- Mistral Francestg Caduff, three rifles and one bayonet

- Benedetg Albert Arpagaus, one rifle

- Gion Martin Caduff, one rifle and one bayonet

- Children of Giusep Collenberg, three rifles

- Mistral Gieri Arpagaus, four rifles and one bayonet

- Hans Antoni Caduff, one rifle and one bayonet

- Giachen Arpagaus, one rifle

- Murezi Andreia Caduff, one rifle and one bayonet

- Francestg Antoni Arpagaus, one rifle and one bayonet

- Mattias Murezi Arpagaus, one rifle

- Gieri Francestg Caduff, three rifles and two bayonets

- Balzer Antoni Arpagaus, one rifle

- Murezi Antoni Arpagaus, one rifle and one bayonet

- Crest Gieri Arpagaus, one rifle

- Stefan Fidel Collenberg, two rifles

- Hasper Collenberg, one rifle

- Hans Gieri Casanova, one rifle

- Murezi Antoni Arpagaus, three rifles

- Risch Collenberg, two rifles

- Gion Barclamiu Collenberg, one rifle

- Marti Hasper Arpagaus, one rifle

- Albert Antoni Collenberg, one rifle

- Martin Flurin Cavegn, one rifle and one bayonet

- Hercli Antoni Casanova, one rifle

- Stefan Vieli, four rifles

- Crest Mattias Cavegn, one rifle

- Mistral Fidel Casanova, one rifle, one bayonet.<sup>503</sup>

Cumbel thus had at that time at least 49 men capable of bearing arms. Among them appear four mistrals.


### 4. Names and Forenames

### a) Forenames

We take as a basis a «status animarum» made by P. Nicolaus in 1884. Our statistician arrives at a number of 435 citizens of Cumbel, including 36 who had emigrated abroad and 57 domiciled elsewhere in Switzerland. Of these 435 persons the forename is, however, missing for 8 «sons» or «daughters of such and such». Thus we can occupy ourselves with the forenames of 427 persons of Cumbel who lived between ca. 1800–1884.


#### 1) Male Forenames

Of the 427 «citizens» 206 were men. These 206 bear together 399 masculine names. Of the 206 men (children and adults) only 23 bear only one forename, 173 two forenames and 10 three forenames.

*The choice of forenames* was a hundred years ago extremely limited and was restricted principally to about a dozen, namely: Gion, Antoni, Francestg, Murezi, Rest, Balzer, Fidel, Giusep, Giachen, Stefan, Gieri and Flurin. Anything else occurred only rarely.

*The most frequent forenames* in order of frequency:

| | |
|---|---|
| Gion | 67 |
| Giachen | 18 |
| Johann and Hans | 4 71 |
| Stiafen, Stefan | 15 |
| Antoni, Toni | 70 |
| Gieri | 12 |
| Francestg | 27 |
| Flurin | 9 |
| Murezi | 26 |
| Martin | 6 |
| Cristian, Rest | 26 |
| Luis | 5 |
| Balzer | 23 |
| Luregn | 5 |
| Giusep | 21 |
| Pieder | 5 |
| Fidel | 21 |

Only 3 times occur: Albert, Barclamiu, Gieli, Luzi and Otto. Only twice appear: Bistgaun, Mattias, Nicolaus, Tschamun and Tumasch. A single time only, quasi only incidentally, one finds among the names of Cumbel of that time: Ambrosi, Andrea, Augustin, Balun, Barnabas, Bonaventura, Carli, Casper or Hasper, Cesar, Doroteus, Eusebi or Sievi, Filipp, Ferdinand, Giuchin, Hercli, Jodoc, Justus, Linard, Maria as Sepmaria.

*Observations.* The giving of personal names stands in close connection with the veneration of saints.

1. Of the 399 male names 141, thus more than a third, fall on Gion and Antoni. They are by far the most preferred forenames. St. John the Evangelist, as also St. John the Baptist and St. Anthony are greatly venerated.

2. A second group of preferred forenames are: Francestg, which appears already in third place with 27 and which derives from the veneration of St. Francis, founder of the order of the Capuchin fathers. In 4th place comes Murezi in honor of St. Maurice, patron of the valley, who stands far ahead of Stefan with 15 occurrences, in only 10th place despite being the name of the patron of the parish church. Before him still come the preferred names: Rest, Balzer, Fidel, Giusep and the apostle St. Giachen (James). St. Gieri (George) has always enjoyed a great veneration among us, as also St. Flurin, the second patron of our diocese, while the first patron of the bishopric, St. Lezi (Lucius), is honored among us with only three persons.

3. A third group of names appearing 5–6 times comes from the popular St. Martin, 6 times, St. Pieder (Peter), 5 times, and St. Luregn (Laurence), 5 times. But also the young Jesuit St. Aluis (Aloysius), Luis, 5 times, has always had his attraction.

4. The otherwise so venerated and popular plague saint, St. Bistgaun (Sebastian), is honored in our register only through two bearers of his name, just like the two apostles Mattias (Matthias) and Tschamun (Simon). Also the very popular St. Clau, Nicolaus, Uclau, must content himself with only two bearers of his name. On the other hand he lives on in the old custom of St. Nicholas (Clau) to this very day.


#### 2) Female Forenames

Taken all in all, with the female forenames things are somewhat like with those of the men. Of the 427 persons of Cumbel who lived between ca. 1800 and 1884 and who were counted in 1884, 221 are of the female sex.


Of these 221 persons bear only

- 1 forename: 13

- 2 forenames: 174

- 3 forenames: 32

- 4 forenames: 2, making together 465 names.

Of these 221 women roughly three quarters bear the forename Maria, mostly in combination with a second or third forename, namely 170. At a great distance follows Onna (Anna, Marionna), namely 48 times.

A group of 12 names appears quite frequently: Mengia 30, Catrina 25, Barla 24, Urschla 24, Giuseppa, Seppa, Josefa 18, Margreta 14, Turtè 12, Castgina, Stina 11, Nesa 10, Mierta 8, Lisabet 7 and Giuanna 6 times. Only 5 bear the name Frena, Madleina and Victoria. Four are named Fengia and Brida. Only three have the name Gada and Genoveva. There are only two bearers of the name Appolonia or Balugna, Clara, Paula, Telgia (= Ottilia) and Veronica. A single time only appear the names: Angelina, Angela, Augustina, Antonia, Carlina, Cresenzia, Ludovica, Giulia, Frona, Columbina, Giuliana, Settimia, Luisa, Helena and Wilhelmina.<sup>504</sup>


### b) Bynames

As also in other localities in general, so too it was and still is the custom to give a large part of the citizens a byname (surnum) instead of their own name and forename. Mostly it is a byname derived from the parents, the so-called patronyms, or from the occupation, from a certain physical quality or defect. We restrict ourselves here only to bynames from a hundred years ago. There are no insults, all honorable and fine bynames.

*Patronymic bynames:* Gion Stina, Gieri Francestg dil Crest, Francestg da Rest Marti, Mengia da Gieri Antoni, Giuseppa da Francestg Antoni, Anna dil Crest, Catrina dil cuitg, Balzer Barclamiu Sievi, Onna da Gion Giuchin, Mengia d'Albert, Murezi da Rest Linard, Catrina da Hans Gieri, Stina da Balzerott da Toni, Urschla dil Vegher, Balzer dil Deda (at Brescia), Gieri dalla Turtè, Clau da Marti, Gion Luregn da Hasper Giusep, Mengia da Fidel, Albert da Stefan, Gion da Giachen Francestg, Rest da Flurin, Nesa d'Augustin, Veronica da Victoria, Onna da Paula, Stefan da Balzer da Scrivon, Murezi Frona, Barla dil pot.

*Distinguishing bynames:* Rest Antoni Grond (the big), il fravi Vegl (the old smith), Tschamun Grond (the big), Francestg da Gieri Grond, Balzer da Giachen da Murezi Pign (the small), Francestg da Francestg da Rest Antoni Pign, Francestg Pign, Filomena da Fidel il Vegl (the old), il Talianer Grond (the big Italian), il Talianer Pign (the small Italian).

## XII. Communal Affairs

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-42.jpg" caption="Cumbel" %}

It cannot be a matter here of a history of the commune, which is not our subject, but rather of some facts and features here and there, more from cultural and folkloristic life.


### 1. Commune and Parish

Parish and political commune lived alongside each other. At the communal assembly all ecclesiastical matters and religious affairs were also dealt with. At the communal assembly of 1 March 1903 the communal president specified on the matter: «Since the Catholic parish of Cumbel has no special organization, the inhabitants being exclusively Catholic, ecclesiastical affairs have always been deliberated on the occasion of communal assemblies under the presidency of the council.»<sup>506</sup> The earliest parish statutes that could be found date from 3 December 1905 and in their paragraph 3 it is stated: «The parish assemblies are convoked and directed by the civil council. In return the administration is entrusted to the benefice wardens (ugaus pervenda), who are authorized to represent the parish before civil and ecclesiastical authorities and to sign all documents for the parish . . .»<sup>507</sup> In this case it is not surprising that everything was decreed and decided at the political commune: when to say mass on holy days and weekdays, when to read the roll of the dead, when and how to ring the bells, and it goes without saying how many paternosters to say for the Month's Mind mass (messa caudonn) and over the graves. Somewhat remarkable is the resolution of 1880, which ordains that graves should be dug only on the day of burial and not already the evening before.<sup>508</sup> No less peculiar is the communal resolution of 1894 concerning «following the coffin» (ir suenter bara): «On funeral days every household or a representative of it must appear, under penalty of 1.– fr. if not sufficiently excused.»<sup>509</sup> This obligation was annulled only in 1906.<sup>510</sup> Yet only in 1898 did the commune resolve a cultus tax, «to supplement what is lacking from the benefice property<sup>511</sup>». Not infrequently, however, at the assemblies things were also resolved that displeased the father. Then he was not prepared to consent and either he refused directly or he ignored the resolution.<sup>512</sup>

The separation of the parish from the political commune was executed only in 1949 with the «Parish Statutes» still signed by the communal council and accepted in December 1949. They went immediately into effect and the separation was accomplished. From then on the two communities hold their assemblies separately. As *presidents* of the parish the following have served:

| | |
|---|---|
| 1949–1954 | schoolmaster Lorenz Casanova |
| 1954–1961 | schoolmaster Giusep Vieli |
| 1961–1967 | Alfons Arpagaus |
| 1967–1975 | Murezi Paulin Arpagaus |
| 1975 | schoolmaster Giusep Vieli |


### 2. The Lumnezia Road

It did not come from one day to the next. Already in 1860 the Grand Council had granted a road into the Lumnezia. And from that time there existed a project for a road from Glion along the Glogn toward Peiden with a bifurcation at Cumbel-Vella and Peiden/Bogn-Uors-Val. Cumbel and Vella were in agreement, while the communes further up objected and lodged an appeal all the way to the Federal Court. That court found the appeal justified.<sup>513</sup>

Immediately the project with the existing line was on the table. The construction of the 3rd section of it (1st section Glion-Valgronda, 2nd Valgronda-Uors), from Valgronda to Vella at 3.117 km, was published in the Official Gazette on 31 August 1872.<sup>514</sup> Engineer Alfons Balzer had elaborated the plan in 1868. According to it the road was to lead approximately along the old road through the village, that is on the lower route. Against this the communes further up again rose up. Especially Morissen, which feared that its connecting road to the main road would be too long.<sup>515</sup> Vella, Vignogn and Lumbrein protested vigorously against it. The commune of Cumbel had of itself requested that line. But the communes of the Lumnezia demanded the execution of the Balzer plan with the upper line through Cumbel, because it was shorter and more beautiful and corresponded to the needs and interests of the other communes. Expropriation would thus also be cheaper. And not the commune of Cumbel but rather the district (cumin) had taken on the expropriation. The lower line was desired by some from Cumbel for their own interest and not for the interests of the valley. «The obstinacy» and partiality of the commune of Cumbel did not deserve that one grant it «special privileges at the cost and expense of the other communes<sup>516</sup>».

For the lower line principally Dr. Gion Barclamiu Arpagaus exerted himself. Letters upon letters that he wrote to chief engineer Franz de Salis and to the department are still at hand in the cantonal archive. It would lead much too far to go into all that. While mistral Dr. Gion Arpagaus argued that the upper line led past the village instead of through it<sup>517</sup>, Luzi Elvedi wrote the opposite to engineer Franz de Salis, against the «scribblings» (scrivems) of Dr. Arpagaus, and warmly recommended the upper line.<sup>518</sup> In the commune there was no unity on this question. Therefore the government asked the commune to give an official opinion, for one or the other variant.<sup>519</sup> The citizens decided for the lower route by 45 against 10 votes.<sup>520</sup> Yet the detailed plan with the upper route — the existing one — was already at hand. The battle continued. The commune assembled on the matter once more on 8 October 1871. And the council wrote to Cuera: «. . . The great majority still finds itself not satisfied with the direction now staked out (the upper one) by engineer Balzer and would wish that it be kept lower. 44 citizens present. Of these, 34 wished the direction lower through the commune and 10 were satisfied with the staked-out direction.»<sup>521</sup> But at Cumbel the spirit of contradiction arose. Engineer Balzer complained that the staking posts were being pulled out and thrown further away. The government addressed itself to the communal council and to the district office with threats of penalties in case of resistance.<sup>522</sup>

In the end the upper route was decided upon after all, probably in consideration of the communes further up. In consequence one barn had to be removed and four others reduced.<sup>523</sup> The solution did not please all the citizens. Particularly they made reproaches on account of the insufficient accesses to and from the new road. Engineer Franz de Salis, however, defended himself by declaring to the department that the road had been lowered in two places precisely for that reason, by 1–2 meters. The difficult terrain allowed no other solution. He had stayed long enough at Cumbel. Nobody had desired anything and nobody wished to confer with him.<sup>524</sup> A malcontent from the Cumbel council wrote to the government a quite original letter, of which it would be a pity not to publish at least some passages:

«Highly esteemed Small Council,

The reply which you, most esteemed gentlemen, have been pleased to give to our letter of 28 June, gives us occasion to respond with a few words.

Above all we are surprised to observe that the reply was given to Dr. Arpagaus, although he had written by commission of our commune. Yet that is of no consequence . . . We had written to the high government to see to it that in our village one could comfortably communicate with the new road, and to come to our aid with a technical opinion, in favor of the correction of the road through the commune, which we have resolved to undertake. This and nothing else have we desired. Indeed, when the road was built, in such a manner that we could not get to it (¾ of the village), we endeavored to understand the mysteries. How could we have taken notice, when neither the one nor the other engineer took the trouble to greet us. As it appears, the chief of the road office has no knowledge of the fundamental obligation to greet the councils where it is a matter of building a new road. For now we understand his behavior. If no such regulation existed on that matter, it would go without saying to hear the wishes of the councils. We have no news that the resolution of the Grand Council of 10 February 1855 has ever been annulled; it is to be read in the collection of laws, volume I, p. 269, number 2, letter b. Never have the engineers deigned to greet us with regard to the road at Cumbel. Such behavior is not suited to inspire confidence. Even if we are peasants and not people of higher studies, we know nevertheless that a servant of the state is there for the people and not the people for him. . . That it should have been necessary to build the road at Cumbel on retaining walls, we do not understand and no one who passes through can approve it. Why take a direction that is so difficult and so costly? Enough, we do not wish to dwell on irreparable things. The purpose of our present letter was to ascertain that we were never either greeted or consulted.

However, we have subsequently had occasion to confer with engineer Peterelli and he wishes to try to meet our desires. With regard to the accesses in the commune the terrain hardly permits anything pleasant or convenient to be devised anew. It has been excavated deeply in only one place and that tunnel stands in no relation with the lateral communications.

To facilitate the accesses, it was not excavated deeply, and to inconvenience them, on the contrary, it was raised up. It appears that they do not know how it was done. There was also no need to make curves, since one comes and goes with electricity. (!) Where they have excavated deeply, one must go with ladders to get into one's house and barn. To tell the truth is always proper. That private property should be taken has never been our wish. In that regard we are at least as clean as other people. No offense, most esteemed gentlemen, that we have detained you a moment again.

Accept in conclusion our most humble compliments, Th. Arpagaus, council.»<sup>525</sup>

On 5 November 1873 the section Valgronda-Vella was inspected in the presence of government councillors A. Bezzola and P.A. Soldani, chief engineer Franz de Salis, engineer Carli Peterelli as director of the works, mistral Gion Demont, judge Luzi Elvedi of Cumbel and the presidents of the communes. In the village of Cumbel some minor improvement had still to be made with regard to the accesses and exits.<sup>526</sup>

With the new road the rectory of Cumbel lost a piece of its garden and also the running water for washing, since the fountain had been relocated further down. The father received a water pump in compensation. The damage was still not compensated to this day, he grumbled: «They gave many words, but no compensation. Patience!»<sup>527</sup>

Once the road was built, traffic dangers were already seen, as a protocol of 1907 relates: «The observation that coachmen and carters etc. drive through the village in a manner dangerous for children and elderly people: It is resolved to issue a relevant prohibition and to impose a fine of 2–5 fr. Of the fine the informer receives 1.– fr.»<sup>528</sup>

The boundary stone that separates the districts of the Foppa and the Lumnezia, formerly by the old road, was according to a resolution of 1882 to be placed at the edge of the new road.<sup>529</sup>


### 3. Forestry and Alpine Matters

The commune has from of old been mindful of *protecting* its forests: the forest of Fiugs, of Suloms, of Sax on the territory of Camuns, and that of La Pun, which it possessed jointly with Vella and Morissen, Peiden and Camuns.<sup>530</sup>

In 1612 the neighborhood (vischinadi) declared a part of the forest of Suloms a protected forest (schétga, Bannwald).<sup>531</sup> In 1671 the neighborhood again decreed that whoever settled outside its territory could no longer enjoy his forest rights. On the other hand, if someone acquired house and yard in the neighborhood but not the forest rights, the neighborhood should take over those rights. Additionally it was forbidden under penalty of one crown to sell timber «from the forest given the valley of Caparli<sup>532</sup>». In 1705 new statutes were again issued to prevent forests being alienated through removal or sales.<sup>533</sup> A document of 1718 declares what portions of forest and timber (cagliom) belong to the individual households.<sup>534</sup> And only in 1886, when the district office informed the Cumbel council that timber was being taken from the Cumbel forest to build the road from Vella to Vrin, the council protested vehemently. The forest of Suloms was private forest and to protect it, they had gone for timber to the forest of Sax at even greater cost. And for the schoolhouse in 1876, one had been able to obtain only a small quantity of timber from the communal forest.<sup>535</sup> A resolution of 1848 even forbids tearing off the bark of pine trees so as not to cause damage to them.<sup>536</sup>

By judgment of the district court of 1 September 1875, the forest of Suloms was declared the property of the commune. The commune held the right to the land and the possessors of forest portions had only the enjoyment «of what grows therein». This constituted a relationship of servitude in the forest of Suloms. However, the cantonal forest ordinance of 30 June 1877 prescribes in its paragraph 18 that all forest servitudes must be resolved. For this purpose the Small Council appointed district commissions to liquidate the matter. To comply with the law and find a way to resolve the servitude at Suloms, this commission conferred at length with the council in 1893. The commission proposed to buy out the private owners of their forest portions at a reduced price and thus «make the forest communal». They went back and forth without result.<sup>537</sup> One year later, in June 1894, after several conferences between the cantonal commission for the resolution of forest servitudes and representatives of the commune and of the forest owners at Suloms, the following resolution was reached: 1. An attempt should be made to transfer the Suloms forest gradually to the commune. 2. Until execution, the commune should make efforts to protect the young growth from grazing.<sup>538</sup> In the years 1960–70, after numerous assemblies, the commune succeeded in buying out the last private rights at Suloms.<sup>538a</sup> A similar method of resolving the servitude in the forest of Sax at Camuns was found and signed at Peiden/Bogn on 18 June 1894. According to it Camuns lost the right of pasturage so as to protect the young growth.<sup>539</sup> The same applied to the forest of La Pun.<sup>540</sup> At the same time as the last extinguishing of private rights at Suloms, the commune also ceded the forest of La Pun to the commune of Camuns and compensated its forest with new planting.<sup>538a</sup>

A piece of forest on the territory of Pitasch, Scuntras, had at some point in the 17th century come into the possession of «meister Benedetg and Jon Depuoz» of Cumbel through purchase.<sup>541</sup>

The *sheep alp Muretg* on the territory of Duin had been purchased by the neighborhood of Cumbel in 1768 from one Mihel Walt of Valendau for 650 Rhenish guilders.<sup>542</sup> But already in 1771 the smith Gion Antoni Arpagaus acquired that alp for the same price, under the condition that if he should sell it, the neighborhood would have the right of first purchase.<sup>543</sup>

A document of 1709 attests that the neighborhood of Cumbel possessed in the Val an alp *Padanatsch* (Pidanätsch) with 93½ rights.<sup>544</sup> *Pidanatsch* is today poor meadow. According to a document of 1788, Rest Gieri and Gion Tumasch Arpagaus of Cumbel sold that alp Pidanäz to one Gion Antoni Furger of Val, for 447.– Rhenish guilders.<sup>545</sup> – On the alp of *Seglias*, in the years 1893, 1898, 1900, 1905 and 1908, many improvements were carried out with federal subsidy: drainage, canalization, land improvement and roads.<sup>546</sup> – The sheep and heifer alp at *Patnaul* on the territory of Vrin had already earlier come into the hands of the well-to-do Depuoz family of Cumbel.<sup>547</sup> In the year 1874 the commune of Cumbel purchased it for 5250.– fr.<sup>548</sup>, resp. for 5000.–.<sup>549</sup> In 1895 the alp was improved with federal subsidy.<sup>550</sup> In 1903 Colonel Cristian Solèr of Vrin would have offered 4000.– fr. for the alp. The commune did not accept. On that occasion the drive of heifers was reduced to 20 head.<sup>551</sup> In 1904 Col. Solèr leased the alp for 180.– fr.<sup>552</sup> The dairy hut he bought.<sup>552a</sup> In 1922 the colonel also demanded the surrender of all documents concerning the alp, which he said he had purchased.<sup>553</sup> The rights alp *Naulsetg* or simply *Naul* was drained in 1895, also with federal subsidy.<sup>554</sup> In 1954, on the first Sunday of July, the new alpine hut was inaugurated with a small alpine celebration.<sup>555</sup>


### 4. This and That

*The oldest protocol*

of the commune still extant begins only with the year 1772. That year the young physician and later prominent politician, Dr. Gieri Antoni Vieli, began to record the assemblies of the neighborhood with his «Gemeindeprotokoll oder Verzeichnis der von Zeit zu Zeit gemachten Verordnungen und Merkwürdigkeiten der löblichen Nachbarschaft Cumbels» (Communal protocol or register of the ordinances and curiosities made from time to time of the praiseworthy neighborhood of Cumbels).<sup>556</sup>


*District archive.*

In 1912 the district court requested to deposit the district archive «for a number of years» in the communal archive. The commune agreed and ordered a repair of the premises.<sup>557</sup>


*Valtellina offices.*

The official who took on from the district (cumin) an office in the Valtellina had each time to pay the district a certain sum at the end of his term of office. The district distributed to the individual neighborhoods their share. In the year 1752, for example, the district of S. Mihèl (29 September) ceded to mistral Cristian Ulrich Demont of Vella and to mistral Murezi Arpagaus of Cumbel the office of castellan of Maiavilla (Landvogt zu Maienfeld), which was occupied and administered in the manner of the Valtellina offices, for 1600.– Rhenish guilders, with the condition of paying the sum at the end of office.<sup>558</sup> Thus, for example, Cumbel also received in 1773 416 Rhenish guilders, its share, for the office of commissary at Chiavenna. That money was then distributed in the commune among the voters, on the basis of the votes of 1771, when the office had begun.<sup>559</sup>


*Sale of the homeland.*

A currently very topical resolution was taken by the assembly of 1 March 1824: «Resolved and decreed unanimously that no citizen shall be able to sell immovable property, be it land, meadow or buildings, to people or buyers from outside, who do not have a formal certificate of domicile (Heimatschein) or certificate of citizenship (Angehörigkeitsschein), so that the commune is not prejudiced by such sort of people nor brought into dispute, and this is also resolved to be written in the communal register.»<sup>560</sup>


*The revolt of 1794.*

In March 1794 a political uproar broke out in the Lumnezia, spread also to other districts of Surselva and more or less throughout the entire canton of the Grisons. Hundreds and hundreds gathered at Cuera and demanded a criminal court over certain leaders and a governmental reform (Standesversammlung 1794).<sup>561</sup> Among the demonstrators at Cuera there were also some from Cumbel. According to an account the communal treasury paid them 31.– Rhenish guilders in compensation.<sup>562</sup>


*The war of Sagogn.*

From the time of the dangerous confessional uprising of 1702, in which also mistral Murezi Arpagaus of Cumbel played a certain role, the neighborhood of Cumbel had made a provision of 40 rifles, lead and powder.<sup>563</sup>


*Fire regulations.*

In 1771 the neighborhood had resolved to purchase a «fire engine» (sprezza da fiug), since the village was built so closely together and there was continual danger of fire. However, because of «some malcontents» the resolution was not executed.<sup>564</sup> In 1838 Cumbel purchased together with Vella and Morissen a fire engine.<sup>565</sup> In 1875 the commune purchased a fire engine with two hoses of its own for 2300.– fr.<sup>566</sup> — The fire regulations of 1880 provide: «When the Angelus (Ave Maria) rings, fires in smithies, baking ovens and other things must be extinguished, otherwise a fine of 5.– fr. is incurred, half of which goes to the informer.»<sup>567</sup>

Beside the automobile, president Balzer Fidel Arpagaus. Behind the automobile stands the parental house of the writer Luis Arpagaus" %}

*Automobile.*

The aversion to the automobile and the struggle it took to permit automobile traffic in the Grisons from 1900–1925 are well known.<sup>568</sup> Our commune too was no friend of the new vehicle. In 1916 it resolved unanimously not to lift the ban on automobiles.<sup>569</sup> The initiative to permit the automobile at the centenary celebration at Trun in 1924, Cumbel rejected by 45 against 9 votes. In the subsequent cantonal vote of January 1925 the citizens rejected the automobile by 53 against 15. In the last vote on the matter, of 26 June 1925, which permitted automobile traffic, Cumbel had voted 47 no and only 8 yes.<sup>570</sup> Still the automobile was not permitted in the Lumnezia. From a meeting at the village square on 9 August 1925 it is recorded: «Free transit of passenger automobiles through our valley is rejected by 23 to 5 votes.»<sup>571</sup> From a meeting at S. Murezi on 4 July 1926 it is recorded: «It is proposed to inquire whether the contribution for automobiles is still obtainable. In that case, revoke the respective resolution to close the road to automobiles. Otherwise a guard should be arranged, since various automobiles are driving without permission.» The following Sunday, 11 July, at the square: «By 25 against 2 votes it is resolved to open the road to the automobile for the current year, since a corresponding subsidy is granted.»<sup>572</sup> After having given permission, however, the maximum «speed» of 12 km through the village was also fixed.<sup>573</sup>

*The railway in Surselva.*

In the year 1905 the «railway committee in Surselva» presented to the Sursilvan communes a prospectus of recapitulation requesting from them the sum of 725 000.– fr. in shares for the continuation of the railway Glion-Mustér. The Lumnezia was to participate with 20 000.– fr. A meeting of the councils at Vella requested a reduction to 15 000.– fr. This was granted. Notwithstanding that reduction, a single representative spoke in favor, while all the others expressed themselves for refusing the prospectus of recapitulation, under the following, still today interesting, arguments: «The Lumnezia contributed for the first stage La Punt-Glion 60 500.– fr. out of a total of 480 000.– and made a due sacrifice for the main line in Surselva. In the continuation of the line Glion-Mustér the Lumnezia has not merely no direct interest but disadvantages, in that traffic and commerce in general will be directed through the Cadi and that also the cattle trade can develop more vigorously there than in a valley without communication, without convenience and time savings for cattle merchants. Even the tourism industry could suffer from the continuation. One was generally under the impression that the Lumnezia would be isolated and prejudiced.» Despite this pessimistic tone of the meeting at Vella, the commune of Cumbel decided to participate with shares for 1000.– fr.<sup>574</sup>, while the majority of Lumnezia communes refused any participation. Yet later, at a meeting of delegates of the Lumnezia communes at Vella on 16 February 1908, it was unanimously resolved to come forward with 15 000.– fr. as proposed, «and this rather out of solidarity with our fellow citizens, as also to recognize the great spirit of sacrifice demonstrated in the La Punt-Glion line by those of the Cadi, than for the interests the Lumnezia might have in that line<sup>575</sup>».


*Electric power.*

In the year 1918 electric light arrived. The commune resolved to have three «bulbs» (amplas) installed economically in the church, one in the school and one in the dairy.<sup>576</sup> – In September 1926 the commune resolved to purchase a threshing machine with electric traction.<sup>577</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-44.jpg" caption="Song of the night watchman at Cumbel" %}

*Night watchman.*

The function of a communal police was exercised by the night watchman (guardia da notg) and the field warden (salter) resp. impounding officer (pindrer). A sympathetic figure the watchman could be, who in the late hours or toward midnight made his rounds through the village singing his song or sounding his horn (zampugn). According to the communal law of 1862 he had the following function:

1. From 11 o'clock on all taverns and all games etc. must cease. Offenders incur a fine of 4.– fr. 2. If a citizen is violated at night-time at his house with misconduct, faith shall be given to him, upon his oath. 3. It is strictly forbidden to wander about at night-time, that is from one Angelus to the other. 4. This surveillance, as also that over fire, is given to the night watchman, who receives his pay. 5. All penalties must be collected immediately and fall to the communal treasury.<sup>578</sup> – For this meager post women too were engaged, rather as an exception, as for example in 1891 Giuanna Collenberg.<sup>579</sup> The watchman was ordinarily elected on 1 March for one year. His pay in 1894 was 80.– fr. and half a bushel of grain per household and «whoever pays tax another 50 centimes besides<sup>579a</sup>». In 1902 they did not elect a night watchman, letting the office go in rotation «namely every household one turn at a time, under penalty of 1.– fr. for cases of default. The signals are given by blowing the horn for those who cannot sing . . . the night watchman also has to police the inn.»<sup>580</sup>

In 1921 the commune still resolved to maintain the watchman custom by going in rotation and «sounding the alarm» (scadenar il plètg).<sup>581</sup> In 1952, at the assembly of 27 April, it was unanimously resolved to discontinue the night watchman, «but not the inn patrol<sup>582</sup>».

*Field warden and impounding officer.*

An original feature of village life was the impounding (pindrar) of animals belonging to another owner, caught on another's property. The impounding officer, who was elected each time on 1 March, had a certain fee for each animal impounded and for releasing it. As a rule this office was combined with that of the field warden (salter). The communal law of 1862 specifies for the field warden: «The field warden has the obligation, from the prohibition to the lifting of the ban, to watch over the animals of the commune, as also foreign animals. He makes every day his round in and out of the commune. Animals found causing damage are locked in and impounded immediately. A quarter of an hour after the shepherds have come in, the field warden has the right to impound. For remuneration he has one loaf of bread per household and the impounding fee per head as follows: sheep (tiers manedels) 5 centimes, cattle (biestga) 6 centimes, domestic animals (tiers casa) 5 centimes, horse 20 centimes.»<sup>583</sup>

The «regulations for communal properties» of 1902 provide the following: «§ 24. The competence and obligation of impounding animals is entrusted to a field warden. § 25. Impounding takes place in all cases where animals go to places where grazing or staying is forbidden. § 26. After the shepherds have driven the animals into the commune, they are to be put in the barn immediately. One hour later they fall under impounding, even if they are in the commune. § 27. The field warden receives a fixed pay of one loaf per household and the following fees: For local animals, for a sheep (nuorsa) 5 centimes, for a goat (caura) 10 centimes, for a head of cattle (biestg) or yearling (salvanori) 10 centimes, for a horse 50 centimes. Foreign animals: sheep, goat, yearling, cattle 20 centimes, horse 50 centimes.»<sup>584</sup> For this office women too could be elected as field wardens or impounding officers, as for example in 1879 Nesa Collenberg for several terms.<sup>585</sup>


*Goat-keeping.*

While sheep-keeping appears to have flourished, goat-keeping was not suited for Cumbel, owing to the lack of qualified goat pasturage and the threat to plantations. It appears at times to have been drastically curtailed, as the resolution of 1 March 1851 reveals: «It is firmly resolved that whoever possesses or keeps — with respect — cattle, shall not have the right to keep goats, but whoever has them shall be absolutely obliged to dispose of them; on the other hand those who have no cattle may or are permitted to keep two goats and no more.»<sup>586</sup>


*A benefactor.*

Giachen Baltassar Vieli (†1897) gave 1890 to the commune 400.– fr. and expressed thereby the wish that the commune should prohibit «by a legal regulation keeping open guests and giving rounds of drinks after 10 o'clock». The aim was «the well-being, peace, tranquility and consolation of families<sup>587</sup>». In 1892 he gave the alms fund 500.– fr.<sup>588</sup>


*Studies about Cumbel.*

«Cumbel 1967» is the title of a lithographed book, written collectively by a graduating class of the cantonal school of commerce of the city of Basel under the supervision of professors Ervin Arpagaus, originally from Cumbel, and Werner Mory of Riehen.

In this work the following topics were treated, each by a group of students: History of the Lumnezia, the history of Cumbel – Land and people – School – Church – The district of Lumnezia – The political commune – Agriculture – Alpine economy – Forestry – Tourism – Commerce and trades – Flora – Fauna – Geology – Surveying.

In the year 1975 professors Ervin Arpagaus and Dr. Max Wehrli of Binningen were again for two weeks at Cumbel with a graduating class from the above-mentioned school and produced a lithographed work with the title «Cumbel 1975». In that work more specialized topics were treated: Mountain population – Mountain agriculture – Theory and practice of planning – Art and culture – Financial management.

The purpose of both study visits was to confront young men and women from the city of Basel with the people and problems of the mountains.



## XIII. Life and Culture

### 1. Memorable Events

*The valiant women.* Heinrich Ludwig Lehmann, a German, was in the 1770s a private tutor of the Jeckün family in Domleschg. He wrote among other things a history of the Grisons.<sup>589</sup> In it he also reported the battle of the valiant Lumnezia women at Porclas in 1352, as it is known in the tradition.<sup>590</sup> And then Lehmann continues: «Still today those Amazons have lost nothing of their heroism, for they above all animated their men to the popular revolt of 1794<sup>591</sup> and encouraged them to exchange their guard's uniform for the cockade of the Patriots and to be the first to bring down the aristocratic splendor.»<sup>592</sup> When the author wrote this, the distance in time could not be great, only between 1794–1797, so that his report merits all the more credibility. May this praise hold for the valiant women of the Lumnezia in general, as surely also for those of Cumbel in particular! –

*From the Grisons militia.* In the year 1809 the districts approved a cantonal military organization which permitted the districts to recruit and provide the soldiers, the «militiamen» (milissers).<sup>593</sup> It appears that the individual communes had also certain freedoms, since the commune of Cumbel was able to decide in 1815 «unanimously to give to every militiaman, instead of the uniform and everything, 5.– Rhenish guilders from the communal treasury and this in proportion to the time one is in the militia<sup>594</sup>».

*The great bell of Lumbrein.* On 4 March 1876 the four new bells of Lumbrein were brought through Cumbel. While not much attention was paid to the three smaller ones, the great bell attracted all interest. It, with its 3000 kilos, had been conveyed by the coachman of Cumbel, Luis Elvedi, from Cuera to Glion. There 60 men of Lumbrein loaded it onto a sledge made specially for the purpose and pulled it up with 24 oxen. At Cumbel the bell was welcomed with the ringing of its colleagues from the belfry of S. Stiafen and with several rounds of mortar fire. Women adorned it with garlands and flowers and the father went out to the square, made a thundering speech and gave the holy water to the people and to the oxen and thereupon the procession continued.<sup>595</sup>

*The last nuptial mass.* Sur Murezi Rivedi said his nuptial mass at S. Stiafen in 1878 — to this day the last of a diocesan priest at Cumbel. On Christmas Day, at three in the afternoon, the father with the master of ceremonies, sur Bisquolm of Morissen, went in surplice and stole and with bell-ringing down to the parental home of the first communicant (primiziant). A procession formed with the parade of the young men and the entire assembled people, which made its way to the church for vespers. After that divine service a supper was served at the rectory for the spiritual and bodily relatives of the first communicant. From S. Stiafen they again received the first communicant before the parental house. The pupils sang there a song. Then they accompanied the first communicant under the baldachin in solemn procession, with the parade of the young men and the instrumental music of Vella, into the church. The sermon was given by the pastor, P. Nicolaus. The festive meal was served at the rectory, large enough for such occasions.<sup>596</sup>

*Music society.* When it was born could not be ascertained, but probably between the years 1890–1900. For a good half century it played on its brass instruments and delighted the people at religious and secular festivals. The second-to-last assembly of the society was on 22 November 1952. Then nothing more was entered in the minute book until the report of the last assembly on 29 November 1954. Agenda: Whether to continue with rehearsals or dissolve the society. It was resolved «to dissolve the society on the ground that there are too few members to be able to play<sup>597</sup>».

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-46.jpg" caption="The instrumental music 1907" %}

*Tschet Giuchin.* A phenomenal original he was, Tschet Giuchin. Tschet is a Lumnezia form of Rest and Giuchin is the forename of his father. Rest Murezi Caduff was born on 30 December 1774 at Cumbel as son of Gion Giuchin Caduff and his wife Nesa. He died on 24 July 1849. P. Bonaventura da Garesio attests with the entry of this death that he knew, without any schooling, quite well German, French, Latin and Italian. He shunned contact with people and abstained from all evil and all sin («vivus semper fugit hominum consortium et abstinuit ab omni malitia et iniquitate<sup>598</sup>»). Then a good deal more is recounted of the «saint of Cumbel», of what is to be placed in the realm of legend. He prayed much and did great penances; he slept only on boards. He had prophesied: When trousers and pendants reach up to the peak, there will be terrible wars. The plain of Domat cannot absorb the blood that will be spilled. He kept two cows, which he always left lowing. During Lent they had to stand and lie on the bare rock. Around 1845 he is said to have prophesied the world wars with bombers that spit fire. The time when these would break out he specified by saying to one of his relatives: «Not your children, Nesa, but the children of your children will have to go through something.» A good party will be «weakened» so that it will be without hope. Then a turn will come and it will be the last to triumph. Tschet is also said to have known when he would die. He drove his cows up to Seglias. He went with them only as far as below the Bogn and said: «Go, my little ones, in God's name!» He let them go alone to the alp. And they «always arrived safely at the alp<sup>599</sup>».


### 2. Customs and Practices

Customs rather of a religious nature, with the exception of the following: On *New Year's Day* (Daniev) the youth came to the rectory to wish the father a good new year. First came the young men. One of them made a speech. The father responded «appropriately». Then he gave a small card and offered a little glass of spirits to each. Then came the young women and the same ceremony was repeated. Finally came the children and the father gave them a small card and 2–3 centimes.<sup>600</sup>

On *Holy Cross Day* (Sontgilcrest), after vespers, the captain of the young men made a speech before the small door for the welfare of the parade of the young men. The father likewise responded with a short speech and offered the young men six liters of wine down at the schoolhouse.<sup>601</sup>

*The feast of the patron father St. Francis* was celebrated solemnly, still until near the last war years, in the time of P. Urban (1905 to 1917) as follows: On the eve, at three in the afternoon the bells were rung together. At half past four confessions began. Outside confessors were the pastor of Pleif, of Morissen and the father of Rumein as well as the visiting confessor and preacher, and here and there also the pastors of Vignogn or Degen. On the morning of the feast the Angelus rang at four and at half past four one began again with giving and taking penance. At half past five was the first and at half past seven the second early mass. At the solemn high mass a great people was assembled and the many clergy of the Lumnezia. On the Sunday of the *Heart of Mary* the young women carried the votive image of St. Victoria and that of Our Lady.<sup>602</sup>

*The Forty Hours* devotion was introduced in 1930 at the bishop's request. The Blessed Sacrament was exposed from morning until evening for three days. A visiting preacher gave two sermons a day. Every day solemn high mass, vespers and rosary with sermon.<sup>603</sup> – On *Good Friday* evening, after the remarkable procession with Our Lord in a bier in natural size, likewise Our Lady, dressed in black and with the boys carrying the instruments of the Passion, as many as possible, from the pillar of Pilate to the veil; after Our Lord was deposited in the church, the pastor kissed the wounds of Our Lord and after him the entire people.<sup>604</sup>

*«Reciting the catechism»* (Dir si la ductrina). In the time of P. Nicolaus (1871–1895) and in one way or another earlier and later, on Sundays and holy days in the afternoon before vespers, catechism was held for the people. But before beginning with it, the children had to recite the catechism, that is answer the questions the father put. At least two children per turn were called upon.<sup>605</sup> Still in the time of P. Urban (1905–1917) catechism for the people was held before vespers and this every Sunday during school time, with few exceptions.<sup>606</sup>

*«To the holy sacraments»* (Tiels sogns sacraments). The expression has all but disappeared. But then, until near the time of the Second Vatican Council, it meant to go to confession and receive Holy Communion, which was distributed on Sundays and holy days in the morning from 5 until 7 or 8 o'clock. In that interval confession was also heard, which one took on average about once a month. Holy Communion was distributed during that period every half hour. At the solemn high mass on the other hand Holy Communion was not distributed.<sup>607</sup> A general custom.

*Wine of purification,* or wine of Holy Communion. After having received Holy Communion, water or even wine was offered to the communicants.<sup>608</sup> It is, for lack of sufficient documentation, difficult to specify the time and places where the custom prevailed. However, in the year 1744 – it was also in the time of P. Ludivic da Bedizzole (1740–1787) – those of Cumbel (questi vicini) asked bishop Josef von Rost, on the occasion of his confirmation visit, that he order the father «che dovesse dare il vino nella communione» (that he should give the wine at communion), that he should offer the wine on the four feasts. The father had, however, supplicated the monsignor not to grant this, since it had never been the custom here. The bishop nevertheless found it well to counsel the father to comply with the old wish of the people, not out of obligation but of free will and «out of courtesy<sup>609</sup>».

*The holy Viaticum* was carried with great solemnity until well into our century, with the sacristan or altar servers with lantern and little bell and with the small baldachin. On the way the faithful joined in procession, praying all the way to the house of the sick person. From the year 1772 we have news that 12 candle bearers (candelotti) accompanied the Blessed Sacrament. The father of Cumbel that year entrusted 50 Rhenish guilders to the church wardens for «maintenance of the 12 candle holders<sup>610</sup>».

*Offering for the weather.* On the last Sunday of May or the first of June they made an offering in church, the so-called «offering for the weather» (unfrenda per l'aura), or «for the growth of the field». The father had to say ever so many masses for this intention.<sup>611</sup> On SS. John and Paul, 26 June, they held a «light holy day» (firau lev), also to pray for favorable weather.<sup>612</sup>

*At the side altars* mass was quite often said, even sung mass, namely on certain feasts such as the Holy Name, St. Joseph and Our Lady etc. P. Nicolaus notes in his agenda of 1872: Mass is always at the high altar, but the pastor can celebrate it at any other altar, according to his disposition and devotion and to satisfy the piety of some benefactor.<sup>613</sup> *Weddings.* About a hundred years ago the custom existed that the newlyweds kissed the book of the Gospels at the end of the mass and deposited their offering there.<sup>614</sup> Until well into our century weddings were held almost always on a Tuesday. This is based on superstition. Sur Fetz disapproves of this choice of days in his agenda and calls it a «stupid custom» (tuppa moda).<sup>615</sup>

*Head covering.* It is not more than a hundred years ago that the women had to appear at Cumbel, as probably also in other places, in church with their heads covered in the Italian manner. P. Nicolaus writes in his agenda of 1872: «My successors are begged to see to it that women have their heads covered in church. My superiors have ordered that the custom be maintained where it prevails. Where it has already vanished, one can make the attempt, but with good manners, and if one finds obstinacy that causes only disturbances and great vexation, one can desist from the enterprise, but without approving such abuse. Where it has not yet been introduced, one must hold firm and not let it begin in any way and watch over certain attempts that are made from time to time to arrive slowly and gradually at their ambitious and sinful intent.»<sup>616</sup>

*Shooting.* P. Felice da Taggia (1863–1871) wished to stop the firing of mortars on Holy Cross Day to prevent accidents. He met, however, with the greatest resistance from the young men. His successor, P. Nicolaus, therefore tolerated the shooting, but wished that the young men appear every 4th Sunday of the months at the rectory to *recite the catechism* and the young women the following Sunday, and «with this everyone was quite content and thus I always practiced with great success, especially on the part of the young women, who recited the catechism quite reluctantly in church (specialmente dalle giovani le quali mal volontieri dicevano la dottrina in chiesa)<sup>617</sup>».

*Funeral.* When a coffin was carried through the village, the bells were rung and the father received it at the entrance of the village and accompanied it to the exit.<sup>618</sup> According to the communal law of 1862, every citizen was obliged, under penalty of 85 centimes, to follow the coffin.<sup>619</sup> Child burials (baras pintgas) were conducted after mass, mostly without singing, as sur Fetz notes in his agenda. Adult funerals (baras grondas) were always conducted only before noon in connection with the requiem. On the evening before the third and the Month's Mind (caudonn), the dead vespers were sung before the rosary.<sup>620</sup> *Cemetery.* Sur Fetz (1933–42) writes in his agenda around 1940: «A civil abuse are the plots in the cemetery. Many graves are dug before their time and many stand for all eternity. Poor people must beg for a plot. Children are buried at the wish of the parents. An ecclesiastical abuse it is that innocent children do not have their own place in the cemetery. . .»<sup>621</sup> On the occasion of the enlargement of the cemetery in 1959, it was decided to bury in rows.<sup>622</sup>

*Piety for the dead.* A word of praise in this regard sur Fetz expresses in his agenda: «From of old they do much here for the dead. Whoever can, founds a perpetual mass. For this small parish there exist here a great many perpetual masses . . . Most people have their dead inscribed in the roll. . . For every deceased person the people recite three times the Office of the Dead, and on the Sunday after the burial, after vespers, the great rosary. They go steadily to the coffin. Young women collect for unmarried deceased alms for masses . . . For every adult funeral 10.– fr. is given for the coffin bearer and 20.– fr. for the prayer roll. . . A peculiarity at Cumbel is that the relatives have it announced at the end of the service in church that people should come to the house of the deceased, after the Mass of the Third, to distribute alms to the poor. Only few make use of it.»<sup>623</sup>


### 3. Storms and Misfortunes

In 1885 there was a dry summer. The communal secretary records: «. . . a year of great drought, so that the harvest of hay, grain and potatoes totally failed; delegates' meetings of the communes of the Lumnezia, Foppa and Rueun were held to agree on what to do with the livestock, to put them out to hay in other cantons. . .»<sup>624</sup>

In 1890 another «bad year» follows. Our communal secretary reports: «Since on account of the snow, which came up to the water, the alps had to be de-stocked, so that the livestock had to be kept at home for several days, the commune resolved to let each person pasture his animals on the lower pasture. . .» As the protocol of 5 October attests: «on account of the continued wet weather and snows, all animals in the alps, also the sheep, had to be brought down already on 30 August and not driven up again. . . Furthermore great avalanches and landslides of earth and forest occurred on our territory, so that the passage over Prau Dadens las Lieurs became impassable, likewise at Porclas and at Sanetsch-Rumiez; bridges washed away. . .»<sup>625</sup>

In 1919 there was a great shortage of hay. The commune resolved «to sequester all the hay that is on hand and this immediately. . .<sup>626</sup>».

*The foot-and-mouth disease of 1898.* In July 1898 a severe outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (zoppina) broke out at the alp Naul. Veterinarian Blumenthal at Glion communicated by letter to president Balzer Arpagaus that the disease was spreading quickly and the animals should be saved from there.<sup>627</sup> Luven and Vrin were immediately isolated.<sup>628</sup> The council of Morissen communicated on 11 September: «That the foot-and-mouth disease had broken out among the farmstead herds and on the pasture at the same time. The infected animals are locked up in the mountain barns.»<sup>629</sup> But the stock at alp Naul was also infected. Sursaissa refused to put cattle from Naul in its barns.<sup>630</sup> In the course of September one message of Job followed another. Camuns communicated that the farm animals were infected. Luven reported foot-and-mouth disease on its home pasture.<sup>631</sup> Peiden did the same.<sup>632</sup> In Sursaissa the disease had prevailed since the beginning of its eruption in the alps Titschal Davon and Titschal Dadens.<sup>633</sup> At Cumbel, so it was claimed, the disease had come through a cow driven from Naul. Here all animals now had to be kept in the barn.<sup>634</sup> The department had ordered the Cumbel council to post guards at Cumbel toward the communes further up.<sup>635</sup>

From the various correspondence and especially from the interrogation conducted with the dairyman (signun) of Naul it emerged that the disease had first broken out in the alps of Sursaissa, Titschal Davon (Vorderalp) and Titschal Dadens, already on 20 July. Young cattle from Naul had strayed into those alps and brought the disease back to Naul.<sup>636</sup>

During the late autumn the epidemic appears to have ceased. At least nothing more is heard of it. – But it still had a tail. It concerned the guard that Cumbel had posted at the borders toward Vella by order of the government. The communes of Vella, Vignogn, Degen and Lumbrein refused to pay the 147.– fr. Cumbel appealed to the Small Council. The latter consulted the communes. These replied that they had at the time protested against posting guards because it made no sense. The guard had even neglected his duty; he had several times accepted hay from coachmen and carried it himself to Cumbel. The herdsmen from Naul had come with their own droves from Naul with their cattle. The said communes proposed to refuse the demand for payment of the guard. The government declared that Cumbel had been obliged to post the guard. If the guard had then not done his duty, this must be dealt with separately, but had no bearing on the question of payment. The appeal of the commune of Cumbel was justified. The communes of Vella, Vignogn, Degen and Lumbrein were compelled to pay the commune of Cumbel the cost of the guard in the amount of 147.– fr.<sup>637</sup>

## XIV. Personalities

### 1. Prominent Figures

#### a) P. Zaccarias da Salò

The date of birth is not known. His father was from Salò in Italy, his mother from Rendenna in the Tyrol. Ca. 1655 he came to the mission, first to Cumbel to P. Ireneo to learn Romansh. Then he is to be found at Danis as assistant for a few years until ca. 1660, then at Lantsch and Brinzeuls in 1661 and at Tarasp in 1662/63. From 1664 to 1679 he was outside the mission, probably in a monastery of his province studying the sources for his literary works. In 1679 he returned to the mission at Riom, at Lantsch 1680–1682 and at Brinzeuls 1682/83. In the year 1684 he came to Cumbel, where he remained for over 21 years until his death on 27 February 1705. Here he was also buried in the parish church. Here he was humbly assistant to P. Basilio d'Iseo until 1703 and to P. Bernardino da Concesio, occupied as he was as writer and man of letters.<sup>638</sup>

*His works.* 1. «Cudisch da ductrina» (Catechism), a catechism, published 1663. 2. «Spieghel da devoziun» (Mirror of Devotion), a book of some 700 pages, with religious instructions, devotions and prayers, printed at Verona 1665 and at Bolzano 1676. 3. In 1679 his great work appeared: «La lucerna sopra il candeliere accesa» (The Lamp upon the Candlestick Lit). This work of some 1000 pages he had written before coming to the mission for the second time.

At Cumbel he had printed: «Canzuns devoziusas, da cantar en baselgia . . .» (Devotional Songs, to Sing in Church), 1685. Between 1685–1687 he had printed the well-known work «La Glisch sil candelier envidada» (The Light on the Candlestick Lit), a work in the Romansh language, which he had translated from his «Lucerna», divided into twelve chapters and here and there somewhat abridged.

In the year 1695 he still published his «Cuort compendi dallas reglas per la cumpagnia dalla ductrina cristiana . . .» (Short Compendium of the Rules for the Company of Christian Doctrine), printed at Panadeuz by P. Maron, a work which he had in any case written at Cumbel.

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-48.jpg" caption="Title page of the book «La glisch sin il candalier»" %}

In the year 1684 the itinerant printer *Gion Gieri Barbisch,* originally from Bludenz in the Vorarlberg, arrived at Cumbel. He set up with his press, probably in the large new rectory house, expressly for the two books of P. Zaccarias, «Canzuns devoziusas» and «La glisch sil candelier». He had brought with him the young apprentice Pieder Maron of Panaduz, who later himself took up printing books. The work at Cumbel lasted until 1687. In between, Barbisch had also printed at Luven a Protestant religious book, the «Sogns discuors» (Holy Discourses). That year, however, Gieri Barbisch died, at only 46 years. He is said to have died at Cumbel.<sup>639</sup> He cannot have been buried here, since the death register makes no mention. P. Zaccarias was an animated champion and defender of the faith, with the special aim of combating Protestant infiltration. There would be much more to relate of this pious and industrious Capuchin father and his books, but we must restrict ourselves, since we can refer the reader to the detailed publications on the subject by Prof. G. Gadola<sup>640</sup> and to the scholarly studies of P. Iso Müller.<sup>641</sup>


#### b) Sur Gion Rest Caduff

He was born at Cumbel on 2 August 1661 as son of «Christ Pizen de Cadoff» and was baptized the same day by P. Francesco da Caino. In 1685, at 24 years, relatively late, he is found at the Papal College of Dillingen in Bavaria as a student of logic. Other dates are — regrettably — not known until 1700–1707, when he was pastor at Siat. He must have been an extraordinarily pious and fervent clergyman, as emerges from his book and from the notice of his death in the parish register of Cumbel, under the date of his premature death; he merited the epitaph (sepulchral inscription) «innocens manibus et mundo corde» — of innocent hands and pure heart. He died on 24 October 1707 at Siat, at only 46 years, and was buried there in the church.<sup>642</sup>

Sur Gion Rest Caduff left behind a blessed and rich inheritance, his book: «Testamen dell'olma u Kunst da ventireivlameing viver e beadameing morir, cuzun cura che in leva o va a dormir, enten igls sogns uffecis, enten las lavurs, co far la confessiun generala a pervergiar etc. Mess giu enten Romontsch della Ligia Grischa digl S.R. Gion Christ Caduff, spiritual da Siath, cun lubientscha dils superiurs» (Testament of the Soul, or the Art of Living Happily and Dying Blessedly, especially when one rises or goes to sleep, in the holy offices, in labors, how to make the general confession and prepare oneself etc. Set down in Romansh of the Grey League by the Rev. Gion Christ Caduff, clergyman of Siat, with permission of the superiors). The book was in any case very fervently used. Proof of this is its 5th edition. The first time it appeared in 1705, printed by Maron at Panaduz. The 2nd edition appeared in 1745 at the monastery of Mustér, the 3rd edition in 1755 likewise. The 4th was printed by Otto at Cuera in 1785. And the 5th time sur Giusep Maria Camenisch saw it to press in 1842.<sup>643</sup>

The contents are divided into 11 parts. The first part is prayers for all sorts of situations and to numerous saints, prayers for every day of the week, even a prayer «against evil people». The 2nd part is an introduction to assisting at holy mass and to «hearing sermons» through to leaving the church. The 3rd part treats «concerning marrying» and the «obligations of a citizen» (vischinadi), of «one who wishes to trade» (handliar, marcadar) or take service, of community life, of labor etc. The 4th part is prayers and pious sighs, «raising the heart to God» on seeing beautiful things, fruits, elements, on passing by a church, on the striking of the hours, when the bells ring etc. The 5th part is devotions for Sunday, for Monday to the guardian angel, Tuesday to St. Anthony, Wednesday to the patron saints, Thursday to the Blessed Sacrament, Friday meditations and prayers in memory of the Passion of Our Lord, Saturday prayers to Our Lady. The 6th part is on general confession and the 7th part on preparing oneself. The 8th part is on the rosary and numerous prayers in all possible situations of life and even how «to raise the heart to God when one cannot sleep». The 9th chapter treats «the spiritual testament». The 10th is «Instructions for comforting the sick and afflicted; confessing and preparing oneself in mortal illness». The last treatise is «Concerning the last rites or taking leave in mortal illness».

Concerning his sources he says in his introduction: «partly drawn from Holy Scripture, from the Holy Fathers or from other fine books, partly also newly composed, how you should serve God morning and evening, in labors . . . let the unexpected death come when it will.» He rarely cites authors; among others a «Paedagogus christianus» without the name of its author, then one P. Benignus Kybler, «Mirror of Miracles»; the catechism of Constance; then Francis de Sales, St. Vincent Ferrer, P. Athanas de Rupe and «Schatzkammer des heiligen Rosenkranzes» (Treasury of the Holy Rosary), without indicating the author. A couple of times he also cites St. Gregory and St. Bernard. In sum, he will have made use of numerous authors of the mysticism and spiritual life of the Baroque period. His conception is thoroughly Baroque. One may compare, for example, his counsels on prayer: «When you wish to drink water; when you see storerooms (Gemach) with much good food to eat, be it meat, bread, cheese, bins with grain, fine clothes or buildings, be they of whatever sort, an oven with bread or other many good dishes at a meal: Let it come to mind, how the merciful Lord God still today maintains and feeds us wonderfully with many and noble foods, as He maintained and fed the people of Israel with the Manna. Would to God that I had fed my soul and clothed it with fine virtues as my unworthy body is today fed and clothed. As many bushels of grain, as many garments, as many fruits as here in this place, so many thousands of times may the merciful God be praised and thanked and give eternal rest to the faithful souls, who have left behind all that we enjoy; say a Paternoster and Ave Maria for the souls.» In such and similar fashion our pious author recommends thinking, meditating and praying: «When you see in cellars much wine, milk or see beautiful fountains, valleys, rivers (Reins), lakes; when you see joyful vineyards, beautiful orchards, laden fruit trees; when you see a fine gathering of people in church, in processions etc.; when you see a fine — with respect — herd of cattle; when you see the serene sky, when the wind blows, when you see the mists, when it rains, when it snows, when there is lightning and thunder, when the sun rises, when the sun sets; when you stand by a warm stove, say with Daniel: Benedicite igni et aestus Domino . . . Would to God that my heart were also as warm and kindled toward Thee, O Lord . . .»

Our good ascetic still writes things of interest today about the veneration of saints and enumerates an entire series of patron saints against the most diverse ills: St. Piaci against headache, St. Leci against eye trouble, St. Balugna (Apollonia) against toothache, St. Andriu against arm trouble, St. Gada (Agatha) against breast trouble, St. Sievi (Eusebius) against back trouble, St. Erasmus against appendicitis (madernatscha), St. Casimir against gallstones (mal dil crap, Gallensteine); against leg trouble St. Gotthard, against the creeps (greufli) St. Joseph, against fever St. Tresa (Theresa), against dizziness (sturnez) St. Genoveva, against falling and going to ruin St. Venantius, who was dragged to ruin by the mane, against sorrows St. Wilgefortis, who obtains great comfort in those anguishes, against fire St. Anthony abbot, against tempestuous weather SS. John and Paul, who obtained from God the keys to lock in and out the mists of the sky; against thunder and sudden death St. Barla (Barbara), against avalanches St. Paul apostle, against evil people St. Benedict, against war St. Murezi (Maurice), against plague St. Bistgaun (Sebastian) and St. Roch, against annoyances and loss of cattle St. Gieri (George), for keeping good house for body and soul St. Flurin. St. Crispin is patron of shoemakers, St. Barclamiu (Bartholomew) of tanners, St. Severus of weavers and St. Leo of smiths; St. Mihèl (Michael) is patron of armorers, St. Pieder (Peter) of surveyors, St. Luregn (Laurence) of butchers and St. Otmar of farm workers (luvers dil funs), etc. – Yet this is only a very small treasure from the rich contents of this instructive book by our good sur Gion Rest Caduff of Cumbel.

#### c) Landrechter Dr. Gieri Antoni Vieli

Of him one could write a thick book, but we must restrict ourselves since there already exists a voluminous monograph on the man, a native of Cumbel, who became one of the most prominent men of the Grisons of his time.<sup>643a</sup> He was born on 6 April 1745 at Cumbel, son of sexton, later mistral, Murezi Antoni Vieli. Died 13 April 1830 at Razén. A sepulchral tablet in the charnel house at Cumbel. He completed his studies at Milan and at the universities of Strasbourg and Vienna and obtained his doctorate at 22 years in 1768. From 1770 he practiced as physician at Cumbel and as physician of the baths at Peiden. In 1771 mistral of the Lumnezia and in 1774 president of the syndicate in the Valtellina. 1777–1791 and 1793–1796 he was imperial administrator of the Austrian lordship of Razén. 1797/98 Grisons delegate to the peace congress at Rastatt. Member of the provisional government. With the invasion of the Austrians he was arrested and taken prisoner to Innsbruck and to Graz, returning in January 1801. Then various political offices. 1805 president of the Grand Council, delegate to the federal diets. 1807 and 1816 landrechter of the Grey League. 1815 president of the court of appeal.<sup>644</sup> He was also active in literature.<sup>645</sup>

#### d) Dr. med. Gieri Antoni Vieli

He was born on 3 November 1811 at the castle of Razén, son of Cristian Vieli and Maria Tresa née Arpagaus. He died as physician at Cumbel, on 14 February 1857, thus at only 46 years. A commemorative tablet in the charnel house at Cumbel bears in capital Latin letters the inscription: «Here awaits the resurrection signor Gieri Antoni Vieli, physician and surgeon, doctor, for 15 years physician in the papal troops, afterwards in the homeland several times mistral of the Lumnezia and member of the Grand Council and government deputy. A lover of the poor.» He was a grandson of landrechter Gieri Antoni Vieli. 1824–1827 he studied at the Catholic gymnasium of St. Gall under the rectorate of Joh. Peter Mirer of Sursaissa. As a young physician he served in the papal armies under General Caspar Teodosi de Latour. From 1847 to 1857 he practiced as physician at Cumbel. In 1849 he was a member of the cantonal health council, 1847–1852 he was a deputy in the Grand Council. 1849–1852 mistral of the Lumnezia. Several of his speeches at the district assembly are published in the Annalas da la Societad Retoromontscha, volume 25, 1910.<sup>646</sup>

#### e) Dr. med. Gion Barclamiu Arpagaus

He was born at Cumbel on 3 October 1810 as son of Luzi Antoni Arpagaus and died on 3 February 1882, also at Cumbel, and was buried there on 6 February. He received the holy oil (Extreme Unction) and the pardon of the dying. After this notice in the death register of the parish there follows the remark in Latin: «Fuit philologus . . . he was a philologist, doctor of medicine and surgery, twice deputy in the National Council, often mistral of the Lumnezia, two or three times cantonal councillor and almost always in one or another office.» Arpagaus studied 1830–1832 the last gymnasium years at Solothurn and 1832–1834 philosophy at Lucerne. The infiltration in those places may have influenced his later liberal stance. Then he studied medicine at Paris and at Heidelberg. At the beginning of September 1838 he submitted to the cantonal health council the request to be admitted at the latest in the spring of 1839 to the cantonal examination. Already from that and other correspondence of the time his literary talent is evident.

1855–1877 he was in the Grand Council for the Lumnezia, with an interruption 1862–1864. In 1848 and 1851 «Bundesstatthalter» (federal deputy). As such he represented in 1852 the government councillor Carlo Ammarca in the Small Council. Lumnezia mistral 1859 and 1865. In 1861 councillor of the cantons. Member of the cantonal commission (Standeskommission) 1858, 1860, 1861 and 1868. Cantonal judge 1856/57, government councillor 1866/67 and 1870/71.

Dr. Arpagaus published several writings, one on the great flood of 1868 and one on the Baths of Peiden. In 1850 he edited the midwives' handbook. Then he edited and directed the newspaper «La Ligia Grischa» 1867 to 1869, as also two annuals of the calendar «Il Glogn» 1867 and 1869. In 1878 he published «Fablas e novellas» (Fables and Stories). – Dr. Arpagaus would also deserve a longer exposition, but we can refer the reader to the extensive study by Prof. Guglielm Gadola, published in «Glogn», vol. 21, 1947, pp. 75–110.<sup>647</sup>

#### f) District president Balzer Arpagaus

Balzer Fidel Arpagaus was born on 22 October 1855 as son of mistral Francestg Antoni Arpagaus and Maria née Capaul of S. Martin/Lumnezia. Died 27 August 1927. He studied to be a teacher at Rickenbach and then taught school at Glion for many years. There he made the acquaintance of his future wife Maria Pajarola. The marriage remained without children. Instead he accepted a newborn child of his brother, Martin Arpagaus, since the mother had died in childbirth. Balzer Fidel Arpagaus administered nearly all the communal offices «for many decades, scarcely anything being done there without his having had the major part in it». For decades he was choir director and organist and then also director of the «Ligia da Porclas», the predecessor of the present valley choir. In 1893 he was elected mistral of the Lumnezia and subsequently was Lumnezia deputy for several terms, thus in 1895, 1899 and 1907. President of the district court. Of president Balzer, sur Baselgia left the following reminiscence: «President Balzer was in sum an erudite man, of piety, peace and beneficence and social sense, concerned for the poor and needy, a counselor and confidant of many.»<sup>648</sup>

#### g) Luis Arpagaus

is considered a talented popular writer. His preferred subject is the peasant life of times past. In a captivating manner he describes scenes from the time of his childhood at Cumbel. At the beginning he concentrated on poetry, later placing more weight on prose. His strength is the short narrative with a genuine language. Some are contained in the Tschespet 29 (1950) «Per rovens e runtgas» (Through Ravines and Thickets). This literary success, however, also brought unwelcome criticism. That setback — together with his somewhat impaired health — persuaded Luis Arpagaus to desist from any publication, so that his works were for 3 decades in a drawer. This is a pity, because in that interval the peasant structure changed and the narratives lost much of their timeliness. Most recently Prof. Dr. Pieder Cavigelli has reviewed the entire estate and prepared a more extensive edition in 4 volumes which will appear with the Casa editura Desertina publishing house at Mustér.


### 2. Mistrals, Sextons, Treasurers and Deputies

Cumbel numbers a surprising number of mistrals and other district officials. From 1800–1925 this village had the most mistrals among all the Lumnezia communes.

## XV. The Household Marks

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-56a.jpg" caption="Signur Albert Caduff" %}

Signur Albert Caduff (b. 1922) at Urdorf/Zurich had, at the request of the author of the «Historia dalla pleiv da Cumbel», the kindness and care to collect in the course of the winter 1981/82 the household marks (nodas-casa) of every household of Cumbel. They served and in part still serve today to mark hay, implements, timber and other goods and possessions. We thank the collector for having retained and perpetuated what currently applies with regard to household marks and are well aware that he has thereby saved for good what was on its way to being lost.

## XVI. Chronicle of Misfortunes

In conclusion of my «Historia dalla pleiv da Cumbel» I go once more to the cemetery of S. Stiafen and remember so many and so many — all of them — known and unknown, who have prayed, labored and struggled.

**The Song of St. Stephen**

In all 7 old editions of the Consolaziun dell'olma devoziusa (Consolation of the Devout Soul), in those of 1690, 1703, 1731, 1749, 1796, 1831 and of 1856, the Song of St. Stephen is also found.<sup>658</sup> This is a sign that it was sung very gladly and very often in Surselva and in Surmeir, all the more so as there exist numerous variants of the melody, indeed three different inflections in the Lumnezia alone, one from Vella, one from Lumbrein and a third from Surrin.<sup>659</sup> Certainly the song resounded often in the church of S. Stiafen at Cumbel, with the *text* as follows<sup>660</sup>:

Regrettably they at the time neglected, or had no occasion, to record the *melody at Cumbel.* We therefore preserve in this place those of Vella, Lumbrein and Surrin.<sup>661</sup>

{% include book-thumbnail.html image="/assets/articles/cumbel-parish-history/Cumbel-67.jpg" caption="The Song of St. Stephen" %}

1. Let us today sing with gladness  
A song of a victory,  
Of a generous deportment,  
Of a great triumph of glory,  
Which the first soldier of Christ,  
Our Savior, merited,  
By willing as His true  
Faithful follower.

2. He is St. Stephen, great patron  
Of this assembly here,  
He who went before the martyrs  
On that rough road,  
Who for love of his Lord,  
With valiant gallantry,  
Overcame and well finished  
His arduous way.

3. The synagogue had stirred up  
A dispute of faith.  
He stopped the mouth of all  
With his high wisdom.  
Then those Jews like rabid dogs  
Gnashed their teeth in fury,  
Thrust him out of the marketplace  
To take his life.

4. Each one with great haste  
Tears off his garment.  
Gives it to Saul to guard,  
Runs to seize the stones;  
Saul gives them courage, they stretch out  
Their hateful arms,  
The target they aim at, the stones they hurl  
With furious force.

5. Like a glorious angel  
His face appeared,  
And that dolorous martyrdom  
He embraced with gladness;  
Kneeling, dearly praying  
That God not reckon  
As a sin to that misguided  
Mob, that strikes him with stones.

6. That prayer had the power,  
Marvelously obtained,  
That Saul in time heard  
The miraculous voice,  
Which made him fall, then rise again  
From a persecutor  
Into a great doctor and defender  
Of the name of our Redeemer.  

7. Through the open heavens he saw  
What greatly consoled him:  
Beside the Father, the Son of  
God who stood and watched,  
How he might pass through that narrow pass  
That leads to life,  
By enduring willingly and giving  
His life in so much pain.

8. That vision filled  
The martyr with joy,  
So that those stones seemed to him  
The manna of sweetness;  
In that comfort he commended his spirit  
With holy composure  
To God, and returned  
In all confidence.

9. O holy patron, now raised on high  
In life so joyful,  
How well you finished that day  
Of your cruel death;  
No harm was done, but rather great good,  
By that heavy tempest,  
Changed well into fair weather,  
Yea into perpetual feast.

10. The stones that those Jews hurled  
Which gave cruel pains,  
Have made a crown  
Of most precious gems,  
Which in eternal splendor there shines  
In glorious heights,  
As the firmament with the ornament  
Of stars has brightness.

11. Pray God today and every day  
That He forgive our sins,  
And as He glorified you on high,  
Crown us here below in grace,  
That at the end when we depart  
We may see the heavens open,  
And thereafter with you there  
Forever may enjoy them. Amen.
