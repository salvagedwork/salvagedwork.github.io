## Introduction

This volume is a continuation of *Jorn in Scandinavia*, published in 1968, which described Jorn’s artistic development from 1930 to 1953 and contained an œuvre catalogue of his oil paintings from that period. The present book follows a similar pattern.

The year 1954, as readers of *Jorn in Scandinavia* will remember, marked the beginning of Jorn’s career outside Denmark. His name until then was hardly known abroad, except through his participation in the cobra movement. The period of the present book ends with the year of Jorn’s first big international retrospective exhibition (shown in Switzerland, Holland, and Denmark) in 1964. This exhibition completed a decade during which he reached the full maturity of his artistic powers and gained recognition as a major European artist.

Most of the catalogue illustrations for this volume had already been collected and shown to Jorn for authentication before his fatal illness in 1973. At that time I had hardly begun to think about the text. This text, as it now stands, is therefore obviously much the poorer for the lack of guidance and criticism which Jorn would certainly have provided (as he did for the first volume), if he had lived long enough to see the book into print. His untimely death came as a severe shock to me. We had known each other since 1956 and our friendship had grown with the years. After his death I had no incentive to continue with the book. That it nevertheless came to be written is due largely to the persuasion of my Danish colleague Troels Andersen who felt, as did others, that the book would provide a tribute to Jorn’s memory.

When Jorn left Denmark in 1953 he did so in the hope of establishing himself as a painter either in Italy or France. Since he had no private means he risked the humiliating possibility of having to return home if the experiment failed. His decision to emigrate was caused mainly by his disillusionment with the art establishment in Denmark. Never having been offered a public commission the most he got from institutions like the Art Society of Copenhagen was their inclusion of him in an exhibition of *Three young painters* in 1953. He felt that if his official rating in Denmark was no higher than this he would do better to try his luck abroad.

If the plain and obvious reason for his departure was the frustration of trying to build a career in post-war Denmark, there were also other factors that drove him into taking a deliberate gamble on the future. Among these factors was his association with the Belgian poet Christian Dotremont, who showed him a lifestyle of nomadic Bohemianism that had a certain tragi-comic originality. Dotremont, in his solitary wanderings through the more desolate parts of Sweden, used to carry his latest poems and jottings around with him in a battered suitcase. When the suitcase became too heavy he would simply abandon it !

During a stay of seventeen months in hospital with tuberculosis from 10 May 1951 - Dotremont being in the same ward with him for part of the time - Jorn decided that the elements of ‘risk and chance’ would govern his life in future. The image of the Wanderer appears in certain paintings: *Buttadeo* (1951) and *Melmoth* (1955). Buttadeo and Melmoth are variant names in the ancient legend of the Wandering Jew. He is sometimes a doubter, who wanders over the earth spreading heresy and disbelief and unable to die, and sometimes a man in search of his soul and ultimate redemption.

Jorn regarded himself as a wanderer and ‘survivor’, by temperament as well as by deliberate strategy, in contrast with those artists of his generation whom he saw as self-destroyers (e.g. Wols, Pollock, de Staël). During the last years of his life the restlessness became more marked than ever. Jorn had homes and studios in three different countries, but he also moved freely to other places, especially when dodging ‘the great artistic success machine’ (Cyril Connolly).

Coming back to the decade that is the subject of this book, Jorn spent the winter of 1953/4 in Switzerland convalescing from tuberculosis. There he made a series of etchings later published as Swiss suite. The following spring he moved to the Italian seaside town of Albisola, where a number of artists from various countries worked together on experimental ceramics. The year he spent in Albisola was artistically rewarding, though he had a hard struggle to keep himself and his family alive on his meagre earnings.

The first favourable break came in 1955 when Carlo Cardazzo, a dealer of international standing, gave him an exhibition at the Galleria d’Arte del Naviglio in Milan. The same year the sale of a series of *Dream pictures* at Galerie Birch in Copenhagen raised enough capital to enable him to buy a flat in Paris, at 28 Rue du Tage - off the Avenue d’Italie. The rooms were small but Jorn was used to working in cramped conditions. He had never so far (at the age of 41) owned a studio.

At about this time Monsieur Henri Lazard, a member of the family of merchant bankers, bought *The witches of Pozzo Garitta* (Cat.937) and some drawings. The money from this sale was just enough to ensure Jorn a foothold in Paris for a few more months. The following year an exhibition at Galerie Rive Gauche in Paris, with a catalogue preface by Jacques Prévert, consolidated his position.

At the end of 1958 the struggle for survival was suddenly and dramatically reversed into the opposite problem : how to cope with the arrival, out of the blue, of success and - since 1960 - affluence. During the year 1958 Jorn had one-man exhibitions in Italy, France, Germany, and Britain, but the most important proof of his ‘arrival’ on the international scene was the showing of *Letter to my son* (Fig.28 and Frontispiece), alongside paintings by Willem de Kooning, in *50 ans d’art moderne* at the Expo in Brussels. From now on he found it necessary to take protective measures against the powerful commercial pressures that began to build up against him.

Jorn spent the spring and autumn of 1959 on the gigantic ceramic mural for Aarhus (Chapter 7). He immersed himself in the affairs of the Situationist International movement, sponsoring and financing their numerous publications in France, Germany, Holland, and Sweden. He attended their conferences and spearheaded the many controversies. In 1961 he created an institute for research into pre-medieval art of the Viking period in Europe. This involved, among other things, the engagement of a wholetime photographer, extensive travel in half a dozen countries, and the preparation of lavishly illustrated books. He also donated a large number of contemporary works of art (including many of his own) to the museum of his home town, Silkeborg, in Jutland (Fig.4). He organized exhibitions there of Dubuffet, Michaux, Wemaëre, and Matta, documented in every case by illustrated catalogues of international quality. These multiple activities not only absorbed his by now substantial earnings, but they also provided an impenetrable network of excuses for avoiding undesirable commitments.

From 1959-1962 Jorn’s paintings took on a defensive character. First came the *Modifications* (sentimental old canvases bought in junkshops and overpainted or ‘modernized’); and then *Luxury* paintings. produced by various methods of dribbling and splashing paint. The un-Jornlike appearance of these latter canvases, combined with the use of the already outmoded ‘action’ technique, should have ensured their rejection by the public. But in fact the London exhibition of *Luxury paintings* in 1961 was a sell-out. Jorn was quick to remedy this situation. He raised the prices of his next pictures to a level that effectively curbed demand. This enabled him to produce less work for much the same annual income.

In 1964 a large painting, *Dead drunk Danes*, was awarded a prize in the Guggenheim International Award competition in New York. Jorn made a practice of placing his pictures *hors concours*, but on this occasion his New York dealer, Mr Jon Streep, who owned the painting, omitted to sign the necessary proviso. When news of the award reached Jorn in Paris he immediately sent a rude telegram, rejecting the award, to Mr Harry Guggenheim personally. At the same time he wrote a letter to Jon Streep, stating his reasons for disapproving of art competitions in general. Most people in Jorn’s position would have sent the rude telegram to the dealer and the explanatory letter to the Head of the Foundation. But by reversing the process Jorn reckoned, quite correctly, that the reaction in the American press to his unprecedented manner of refusal would be so angry and hostile that he would remain unmolested from that side of the Atlantic for several years.

The period from 1954 to 1964 has been called ‘the crucial years’ in the title of this book, because these years encompass Jorn’s emergence as a major figure in European art. In the middle years of the decade, i.e. from 1956 to 1969, he produced works of the highest quality. Even during the ‘defensive’ phase, from 1959 to 1962, an occasional masterpiece slipped through. Jorn once explained this phenomenon to me by comparing himself to a conjurer. ‘The conjurer’, he said, ‘stands in front of his audience and gives a dazzling display in the air with his right hand, while he is quietly using his left hand under the table to boil himself an egg.’

Some reference to purely commercial factors has been made in this introduction. The reason is that for artists in the mid-twentieth century connivance in success has proved to be a more certain killer than hunger. Jorn was always very conscious of any threat to his freedom of action and he could become highly devious, almost to the point of paranoia, to avoid succumbing to any single influence or pressure. His simultaneous dealing with galleries in six different countries - on the principle that there is safety in numbers - is an example of this. Each dealer was supposed to be kept in his place by the knowledge that he had several rivals.

To sum up. The decade under review in this book covers the time from Jorn’s departure from Denmark to his breakthrough to maturity and recognition (artistically 1956-8; commercially 1960), followed by four years of *reculer pour mieux sauter*. The ‘defensive’ phase was governed by the reasons already given, but also by the need for a breathing space after the unparalleled exertion of producing the Aarhus ceramic mural, which is one of the largest, if not the largest, mural of its kind in the world. It was made in the shortest possible time and in one single sustained burst of creative energy.

Important landmarks in Jorn’s career from 1954 to 1964 are the *Stalingrad* picture (Fig.32), the Aarhus mural (Chapter 7) and the great sequence of ‘radiant’ paintings1 which include, among others, *Letter to my son* (Fig.28), *Attention, danger* (Fig.98), *Half-moon* (Fig. 108), *Reencounter on the shores of death* (Fig. 131).


## Biographical notes

**1914-1938**

1914-29 Born in Vejrum near Struer in Jutland, Denmark, on 3 March 1914. Asger Jorn’s name at birth was Asger Oluf Jorgensen. His father was headmaster of the village school in Sønder Vejrum. His mother also taught there.

There were four sons and two daughters in the family, but one of the sons died in boyhood. In 1929, three years after the father’s death, the family settled in Silkeborg, Jutland. J. has always regarded Silkeborg as his home town.

1930-5 Began to paint small naturalistic landscapes, seascapes and portraits in 1930. Took a teacher training course and taught briefly in local schools. He was drafted into the Artillery, where he served for some weeks before being invalided out.

J.’s first artistic influences came from the painter Martin Kaalund-Jorgensen, who lived in Silkeborg, and from the exhibitions of contemporary Danish artists which Frederik Dam took on tour round the provinces. Dam became J.’s first dealer. J. learned about modern European art from the books and periodicals he read in the Silkeborg Public Library.

Early literary influences were the novels of Thøger Larsen; Johannes V. Jensen’s collection of myths and his novels on the origins of man; the Edda; and the Finnish epic songs of the Kalevala. J.’s admiration for Thøger Larsen was increased by the fact that he resembled J.’s father, who died when the boy was 12. J. saw the resemblance from a photograph of Larsen printed on the dust jacket of his novel Frejas rok. J. was for many years a Communist sympathizer, although from the outset he was opposed to the prevailing art policy of the party. J.’s political views were influenced by his admiration for the syndicalist leader Christian Christensen who lived near Silkeborg. In 1963 J. sculpted a runic memorial stone for Christensen (Fig.9).

J.’s earliest illustrations were sixteen woodcuts for his Blasphemous Christmas Carols, which appeared in a Danish Marxist magazine in 1933.

1936-7 In 1936 J. went to Paris on a motor cycle (Fig.8). He pulled up on the Place de la Concorde and asked the policeman on duty for the way to Communist Party headquarters. It was there that he made friends who supported him during his stay in Paris.

His plan was to study under Kandinsky. He was surprised to find that Kandinsky had no School and could not even get his own paintings exhibited in Paris. So J. joined the academy of Fernand Léger instead. During the World Exhibition of 1937 he assisted Le Corbusier in the decoration of his ‘Pavillon des Temps Nouveaux’.

1938 First one-man exhibition in Copenhagen jointly with Pierre Wemaëre, whom he had met at Léger’s academy and who became a lifelong friend.

**1939-45**

J. married Kirsten Lyngborg, a schoolteacher from North Jutland, in 1939. There were three children from this marriage. The family lived in Copenhagen throughout the war. For about eighteen months J. printed the monthly issues of the banned Communist journal Land og Folk on a printing press hidden inside an ottoman in his flat.

J. visited the School of Graphic Art at the Royal Academy. Here he produced an edition in ten copies of The jade flute: some Chinese poems with lithographic illustrations. A new version of this was published many years later in collaboration with Walasse Ting under the title Chinoiseries.

An important literary and artistic venture was the publication of helhesten magazine, largely inspired by J. and edited by the architect R. Dahlmann Olsen. J. contributed, among other things, an article in praise of kitsch art and some translations and comments which introduced Kafka to Danish readers. The ‘Helhesten’ group included nearly all the most important Danish artists of J.’s generation : Bille, Heerup, Egill Jacobsen, and Carl-Henning Pedersen - though neither Richard Mortensen nor Robert Jacobsen.

J. experimented in a number of different painterly styles during the war years. Important works in other media were book illustrations, including those for Salvi Dybo (poems by his brother Jørgen Nash); the Didaska water-colours, inspired by a romantic love affair; and the Occupations etchings.

1945 In 1945 J. changed his name from Jørgensen to Jorn.

An event of importance for all Danish artists, shortly after the end of the war, was the exhibition in Copenhagen of some two hundred works by Edvard Munch.

**1946-1953**

J. always had a taste for travel. After being confined to Denmark for the five years of the war, he took every opportunity to make journeys abroad. These resulted in personal contacts which laid the foundation for the cobra movement.

1946 Spent the summer in Swedish Lapland, where he had gone to visit the artist Folke Ricklund. In Lapland J. painted canvases in the colourful, curvilinear, near-abstract style of Saxnäs (cf. Jorn in Scandinavia Bibl.426, Fig.35).

In the autumn he met Constant in Paris and struck up a friendship with him. Later that year he stayed in Amsterdam to discuss with Constant the possibility of bringing out an international review of the arts which was to have the outlandish name sarcoma : presumably an anagram from ARS COpenhagen AMsterdam. Nothing came of this idea, but the discussions helped later when laying down the policy for cobra review.

1947 J. met Christian Dotremont, the future Secretary of cobra , in Brussels.

1947-8 In November 1947 he travelled with his family to Djerba, Tunisia, where they spent about six months. He made a number of paintings there which carry the name ‘Djerba’ on the canvas or are recognizably in the Djerba style. Also from this period are the delightful ‘Hmirah’ drawings and texts owned by Bjørn Rosengreen (Bibl.375, p.38).

1948 First one-man exhibition in France, at Galerie Breteau, Paris.

In early November J. attended a conference in Paris organized by the ‘Surréalisme Révolutionnaire’ group. Six of the participants walked out of the conference in protest at the sterility of the discussions. They met in the café of the Hôtel Notre-Dame on the Quai St Michel to form a dissident group of their own. The six men were Appel, Constant, Corneille, Dotremont, Jorn, and Noiret. At this meeting the cobra movement was founded, through the signing of a short statement drawn up by Dotremont. The name cobra (COpenhagen, BRussels, Amsterdam) was invented by Dotremont some weeks later.

1948-51	The cobra movement lasted three years. It began small but finally numbered about fifty artists from ten different countries. The core of the membership is found among the fifteen artists who featured in the small monographs of the ‘Bibliothèque Cobra’, edited by J.

The main public activity of cobra consisted of joint exhibitions, the most important of which was held at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, in November 1949. The literary effort centred on cobra review which came out in eight issues. A double number (8/9) remained in proof owing to lack of funds.

The importance of the movement can be seen as being partly geographical. The manifestoes and joint exhibitions in Belgium and Holland challenged the monopoly of Paris as the centre for artistic theories and activities. The artists from the three smaller countries welcomed the chance to break out of their wartime isolation and to enjoy the stimulus of friendship, rivalry, and debate. The Danes were the most hospitable, but at the same time the most independent members of cobra . They had already established a separate national identity through groups such as ‘Helhesten’ and ‘Høst’. Although they invited guest artists to exhibit at ‘Høst’, it is significant that no cobra exhibition took place in Denmark until a decade after the movement had ceased to exist.

1949-50 After less than a year J. began to dissociate himself from the cobra movement. This was partly because he disapproved of the general direction the movement was taking, but in large measure it was due to private events that caused a rift with Constant as well as with the Danish cobra artists.

In May and June 1949 J. and Constant, with their wives, took a holiday on the island of Bornholm. During this holiday J. fell in love with Constant’s wife, Matie. After Bornholm the families separated, but J. and Matie spent the autumn and winter together - first in the Frederiksholmshytte in Bregnerød (which the cobra artists had recently decorated with large murals) ; later they were lent a small summer cottage (without heating) at Humlebæk, north of Copenhagen, where they spent the winter.

The liaison with Matie led not only to the breakup of J.’s marriage, but it alienated him from the other Danish artists. They held it against him that he had taken up with the wife of an artist who was a guest in their country. For the first time in his life J. had to face ostracism; which had the side effect of making it harder than ever for him to sell his work. In the spring of 1950 J. moved to a small house in the working-class quarter of Islev in Copenhagen, where his son Ole was born. In the summer Matie’s mother, Mrs A. van Domselaer, came over from Holland to have a look at her grandson. Mrs van Domselaer gave me a brief account of her visit. She found the family (including Matie’s two daughters by her marriage to Constant) living in extreme poverty in their tiny house, but as soon as Mrs van Domselaer arrived J. was all eager to take her and Matie and Ole on a journey abroad ‘to live again’. He decided they should go to Sweden. The two girls were billeted out, and then the four of them set out for the railway station ‘very poor, cheerful and Bohemian’. J. wore sandals and socks (with holes in them, through which his toes protruded) and he wheeled the baby along in an atrocious old pram. They first went to Malmö, where they stayed with a young painter, and then on to Lund. Here J. collected some money from Professor Arbman, to whom he had sold a picture. J. insisted that they should put all the money from this sale into buying a maximum round trip ticket that would take them to Gothenburg, Uppsala, Stockholm, and back to Malmö. The highlight of their journey was the stay in Gothenburg. J. knew Rikki and Ingmar Hamberg, who owned a number of his pictures. He found them at their seaside house, where he was received with rapture. He was then given the loan of their town house in Gothenburg where they could all relax for some time in comfort. The trip to Sweden was a happy interlude in an otherwise bleak existence.

During this period J. painted a group of ‘historical’ pictures with titles like Churchill's entry into Copenhagen, The fall of Hiroshima ; and some war visions entitled The pact of the predators (a reference to the Cold War alignment of the NATO powers), The fire of death, The bereaved, The scavengers. These were dark paintings, both in mood and texture.

1950-1 From the autumn of 1950 to the early spring of 1951 J. and his family lived in La maison des artistes danois in Suresnes, a suburb of Paris. The hostel, which was only big enough to house two families, was administered by a committee in Copenhagen, who also collected the rent. Conditions were primitive to the point of squalor. At the time of J.’s stay the other occupant was the sculptor Robert Jacobsen with his family. Their financial plight was at times almost as great as that of J. and Matie.

In January 1951 J. wrote a letter to Frost Larsen, a lawyer friend in Copenhagen, describing how their Christmas dinner had consisted of onions and a pig’s trotter, the latter reserved for the children.

1951 was a year of angst, constriction, claustrophobia. Wols died that year. There was no air in the world. The winter of 1950/1 was the worst period of J.’s life.

By the spring of 1951 J. had developed severe tuberculosis and external symptoms of undernourishment. He had to return to Denmark where he spent seventeen months undergoing hospital treatment in Silkeborg. He married Matie on 23 May 1951 at the Silkeborg Registry Office. She and the children - a daughter, Bodil, was born in December -lived in a council house in the town.

J. regarded his enforced return to Silkeborg as a personal defeat. He symbolized this defeat in the haggard and snarling faces of Return to the detested town (Bibl.426, Fig.l 14). His attitude to his home town was made up of the same elements of love and hate that characterized his attitude to Denmark as a whole: arising out of a disappointment of his high expectations. Whereas Matie genuinely hated Denmark, J. loved his country and the Danish language, but - with the perceptiveness of the exile - he saw all too clearly the blemishes and shortcomings of the Danish character and Danish social and political life. He once said of Hans Andersen’s writings that they were like Carlsberg Lager: considering the ordinariness of the raw material (Danish society in the mid-nineteenth century) one must admire the palatable taste and splendid packaging of the brew. J. went on to say that Hans Andersen was cold-shouldered in Denmark during his lifetime, but after his death Danes claimed that only they could understand his works. J. foresaw a similar fate for himself.

During part of the winter Christian Dotremont, who had also contracted tuberculosis, was in the same ward as J. in hospital. They made a series of black-humoured ‘word picture’ drawings on the theme of hospital life, published later as La chevelure des choses (Bibl.350). Dotremont also wrote a novel called La pierre et l'oreiller in which some of the hospital experiences are described (Bibl. 322).

1951-2 During his period of recovery in hospital J. was given a studio space (adjoining the mortuary) where he worked on The seasons, intended as a possible basis for a suite of murals in an architectural setting. Ever since working with Léger and Le Corbusier J. had hoped for an opportunity to relate painting to architecture on a grand scale, but no commissions came his way.

The two big panels On the silent myth were made slightly later, when J. was allowed to work in a studio in the town. The theme of this second group of paintings is more heroic and dramatic, based on the notion that ‘the image precedes the word’. A large painting from the 1960s called In the beginning was the image reinforces this idea.

Two books resulted from the long period of compulsory rest. The wheel of fortune (Les cornes d'or ou La roue de la fortune) is closely linked to the subject matter of The seasons. The literary counterpart of On the silent myth is a book of reflections called Risk and chance: dagger and guitar. This was probably begun around 1946 and completed in hospital. It was printed in Silkeborg on a hand press with coloured linocuts which were stamped individually into each copy. Ostensibly concerned with aesthetics, the book’s main attraction lies in the originality of the chapter headings, quotations, and scattered aphorisms, rather than in the logical pursuit of any particular topic.

1953 The important artistic event of the year was J.’s preoccupation with pottery and ceramics. His friend Erik Nyholm had introduced him to the medium some years earlier and J. had also made a few ceramics in a factory while living in Djerba. But now he took up the craft in earnest. In the town of Silkeborg itself he fired some ceramics in an electric kiln under the direction of his former tutor Randlev Petersen, who taught in the local Teacher Training College. Then he worked with a potter called Nielsen in the Frederiksborggade. But by far the largest part of his output came from the workshop of Knud Jensen in Sorring. J.’s work there was subsidized by a grant of 2,000 kroner from the Silkeborg Museum (see Chapter 7).

As a result of the intensive training in Sorring J. was already an experienced ceramist by the time he went to Albisola the following year, whereas many of the other artists there were beginners.

1953-4 J. and his family spent six months in Switzerland, from November 1953 to May 1954, in a rented chalet at Chesières, near Villars-sur-Ollon. There J. made a group of etchings, of which 23 were published as Swiss suite in 1961.

J.’s correspondence with Max Bill and Enrico Baj laid the foundation for the ‘Mouvement International pour un Bauhaus Imaginiste’ (MIBI) the following year.

**1954-64**

1954-5 J. moved to Albisola in the spring of 1954 and made many ceramic vessels and sculptures in the Mazzotti workshop, in the company of an international group of artists which included Appel, Baj, Corneille, Dangelo, Fontana, Matta, and Scanavino. J. knew Appel and Corneille from the cobra days. He had met Matta before the war, when they both worked with Le Corbusier in 1937.

J. was lent Fontana’s studio near the square called Pozzo Garitta (Fig.3), where he watched the carnival masquerade which gave him the title for the painting The witches of Pozzo Garitta.

J. painted the series of dream pictures and frivolous pictures.

He had a one-man exhibition of ceramics in the Museum of Arts and Crafts in Copenhagen and of paintings at Cardazzo’s Galleria d’ Arte del Naviglio in Milan.

1956-9 J. bought a flat in Paris in 1955 and about two years later rented a studio in the same district. From now on he tended to divide his working time mainly between Paris and Albisola. These years were notable for a run of magnificent paintings : Letter to my son, 1956-7, The timid proud one, 1957, Attention, danger, 1957, They never come back, 1958, and others. First London one-man exhibitions were held at the ICA: graphics in 1957 and paintings in 1958. Other one-man exhibitions were at Galerie Rive Gauche, Paris, in 1957 and 1958; Galerie van de Loo, Munich, in 1958. International exhibitions included 50 ans d'art moderne at the Expo in Brussels; Pittsburgh International Exhibition, USA; documenta II, Kassel.

Publication of Fin de Copenhague (with G.-E. Debord) in 1957 ; Pour la forme, a collection of essays and statements on art, 1958; illustrations for C. Caspari’s Friedhof der Maulwürfe (Cemetery of the moles), 1959; Mémoires (with G.-E. Debord), 1959.

The Situationist International movement (S.I.) arose out of an alliance between MIBI and the International Lettrist group. J. was a leading participant in S.I. from 1957 to 1961.

With Pierre Wemaëre J. made a first sketch for the big tapestry Le long voyage, 3 x 27 m.

In the early summer of 1959 J. made the gigantic ceramic mural in Albisola and arranged for its transport to Aarhus, Denmark. The mural was mounted there in the autumn, with the help of three specialists brought from Italy.

Modifications were shown at Galerie Rive Gauche in Paris in 1959, with a preface by the artist.

1960-3 J. and Wemaëre had collaborated on tapestries for many years. An exhibition of their tapestries (at ‘Quatre Saisons’ in Paris) in 1960 marked the closing of the Jorn-Wemaëre workshop (Bibl.341).

From 1959 onwards J. built up the collection of modern art in the Silkeborg Museum by frequent and lavish gifts. The artists who are best represented there, apart from J. himself, are Dubuffet, Michaux, Wemaëre, and Matta, all of whom were given one-man exhibitions. The collection is also rich in works by members of the cobra group, though oddly enough no cobra exhibition has been held at the museum. The long list of modern masters includes Arp, Beckmann, Ensor, Max Ernst, Kubin, Léger, Picabia, Redon, and Wols. Some of the acquisitions were made by direct purchase, others by exchange, others were given by the artists themselves. The most recent gift (1974) comes from Walasse Ting, who has presented some exquisitely lyrical fluorescent acrylics to the museum ‘in memory of Asger Jorn’. The collection eventually became so important that plans for a new building (designed by Jørn Utzon) have been under discussion for some time.1 An exhibition of Luxury paintings took place at Arthur Tooth & Sons in London, 1961, followed by Modest luxury pictures at Galerie Birch, Copenhagen, 1962. Other important exhibitions were Nouvelles défigurations, Galerie Rive Gauche, Paris, 1962, and the first one-man exhibition in USA at Lefebre Gallery, New York, 1962. The big Stalingrad picture was shown in Art since 1950 at the World Fair in Seattle, 1962.

In 1961 and 1963 a large number of paintings - many of them from the private collection of Paolo Marinotti - were included in the exhibitions Arte e contemplazione and Visione Colore at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice (Fig. 13).

After resigning from the Situationist International movement in 1961, J. began to travel extensively through Europe in search of ‘vandalist’ art. ‘Vandalism’ was a whimsical and ambiguous name by which J. referred to art of the Viking period. The graffiti on Normandy church walls, to which he devoted a book, were genuine acts of vandalism, though the patterns made by these mysterious signs tended to embellish rather than defile the walls. But in classifying all Viking architecture, sculpture, and ornament as ‘vandalist’ J. was making an ironical concession to the popular fallacy that Viking=Vandal. The Institute for Comparative Vandalism, which J. founded, was intended to sponsor the publications of some twenty-four to thirty volumes on Scandinavian art from prehistoric times to the early Middle Ages. The project broke down through lack of official support, but J. continued the research on his own initiative. He collected a vast amount of information and about 15,000 negatives and prints. The Institute also gave its imprimatur to some paperback editions of J.’s writings.

1964 At around the time of New Year, during a railway journey on the Continent, J. got into conversation with a Danish industrialist who was in the same compartment. The man mentioned that he was planning to sell a farm on the island of Læsø, off the north-east coast of Jutland. J. promptly bought the farm and never had cause to regret it. A couple of years later he visited the place for the first time. He gradually made it more habitable and added a studio. It became a third home for him (Fig.17).

In January J. rejected a Guggenheim international award for his painting Dead drunk Danes.

During 1963-4 J. made a large number of highly successful collages which were exhibited at his galleries in Munich and Paris. The Paris exhibition was called Réforme de la publicité, a reference to the paper being torn from advertisement hoardings.

The artist’s 50th birthday was marked by the publication of a first book on him in English (Bibl.373), a bibliography of his writings (Bibl.375), and an illustrated study of the Aarhus ceramic mural (Bibl.374). In the autumn the first major international retrospective was shown in Basel. It later travelled to Amsterdam and Humlebæk, Denmark.

A summer spent on the island of Gotland, Sweden, resulted in paintings which were shown the following year at Galerie Burén in Stockholm.

**1965-73**

1965 This was a restless year, in which J. found it impossible to settle down for long enough to accomplish any solid work. His studio at 143 Boulevard de la Gare was a large room in a ramshackle building which was scheduled for demolition. The studio was far from ideal.

J. spent New Year in Munich and not long afterwards accompanied Paolo Marinotti to Mexico, going from there to New York. This was his first visit to the USA.

One of his many other journeys was to Denmark in the spring. On 1 April J.’s Institute for Comparative Vandalism acquired its first and only home in a bungalow belonging to the Railway Company in Silkeborg. The municipality had paid the sum of 4,000 kroner to put the place in order. The building contained a darkroom with plenty of storage space, a bed-sitting room, the rudiments of a kitchen/washroom, a lavatory and a cellar.

During the year J. published the second of his ‘vandalist’ volumes. It was a study of early stone sculpture in southern Sweden and contained 305 large and impressive photographs. These were taken by Gérard Franceschi, who - together with Jacqueline de Jong - accompanied J. on his research tours.

In November J. was in Albisola, where he had by now acquired an old property with a large garden, on a hill overlooking the town (Fig. 14). An important one-man exhibition, sponsored by Børge Birch, made a successful tour in Norway.

The community of Gammel Balle near Silkeborg named one of its streets ‘Asger Jornsvej’, thereby scoring a ‘first’.

1966 This was an important year because J. got back into the rhythm of painting after a long period in which painting played a minor role. In the beginning was the image appeared in the Salon de Mai in Paris. The summer was spent in London, preparing for a one-man exhibition at Arthur Tooth & Sons. J. arrived in June, bringing with him fourteen canvases from Albisola, most of them unfinished. He was accustomed to carrying unfinished paintings from one country to another. He claimed that the pictures improved through travel, like the famous Norwegian ‘linje snaps’. This special aquavit is put on board ship in its barrel and is said to acquire merit from tossing on the seas and crossing the Equator. J. was sensitive to atmosphere and it is possible that he imparted something of his new impressions of a country to the canvases.

He finished the fourteen paintings while staying at 49 Onslow Gardens, N. 10. He then moved to a studio-flat in the Belsize Park area where he started afresh. All these pictures, when shown at Tooth’s in the autumn, were not quite up to J.’s highest standard; but he also made a dazzling series of acrylics which were sent to New York for an exhibition at Lefebre Gallery.

In August J. made a short trip to Scotland to study Saxon antiquities in Edinburgh and around Perth.
1967-70 The Erker-Presse in St Gallen, Switzerland, brought out a folder of lithographs Von Kopf bis Fuss . . .

In 1967 J. visited Cuba at the suggestion of Wilfredo Lam. In Havana he painted the walls of a disused bank with large murals (reproduced in Jorn/Cuba, Bibl.446). The Government of Cuba, in honour of J.’s visit, brought out a 13 cent stamp with a reproduction of his Stalingrad.

J. was in Paris at the time of the May riots of 1968. He made some small posters for the occasion, but did not take an active part in the events. Later in 1968 J. published his most celebrated book La langue verte et la cuite, jointly with Noël Arnaud.

In 1970 he made nineteen coloured woodcuts of outstanding quality in Munich, followed in 1971-2 by twelve others at the Imprimerie Clot, Bramsen et Georges in Paris. His latest collages Au pied du mur were shown at Galerie Jeanne Bucher, Paris. In Albisola he carried out a large ceramic mural commission for the Art Centre in Randers, Denmark.

In the spring of 1970 J. travelled to New York, in the aftermath of a successful exhibition at Lefebre Gallery, where sales had been remarkably good. In New York J. met Nanna Enzensberger, whom he was later to marry. Their son, Ib, was born in October 1971.

From New York J. went on to Las Vegas, Honolulu, Kyoto, Tokyo, Hongkong, and Teheran. This journey took him less than a month. He disliked the East.

By 1970 J. had got himself fully installed in a spacious studio built to his own design in a house he had bought in Colombes, some ten to fifteen minutes by train from Gare Saint-Lazare. The atmosphere and working conditions suited him extremely well. There he painted a number of masterpieces in large format, as well as smaller pictures, which were shown at the end of the year at Galerie Jeanne Bucher (La luxure de l'esthésie). From this exhibition dates a renaissance of J’.s creative strength. The years 1956-9 and 1970-2 were the high points in his artistic career.

1971-3 During the last phase of his life J. devoted his energies to sculpture, a medium he had not attempted before (except ceramic sculpture). In 1972 he made twenty-three bronzes and (at Carrara) six marble sculptures. The pieces varied in height from 10 to 75 cm. Most of the bronzes were single figures, representing humanoid personalities, with all the ambiguities of posture and gesture that characterize his paintings. When talking about these sculptures to his Italian dealer J. said T feel I have concluded what I had to conclude’. (Jorn scultore, Bibl.467, p.(5)). The words, unfortunately, were prophetic.

J. made a folder of drypoint etchings Entrée de secours, Visat, 1971, and illustrations for a short story by the Icelandic poet Halldór Laxness (Die Geschichte vom teuren Brot), published by Erker-Presse, St Gallen. In February 1973 a large and carefully chosen retrospective exhibition was put on by the Kestner-Gesellschaft in Hanover. The exhibition, which had taken more than two years to prepare, contained 139 works, apart from graphics. After Hanover the exhibition went to Berlin, Brussels, Aalborg, and Humlebæk in Denmark. It should have gone to Stockholm, but the Modern Museum cancelled this part of the itinerary.

J. died of cancer in the Aarhus Municipal Hospital on 1 May 1973, after an illness lasting four months. The cremation took place in Silkeborg. His grave is in Gotland, the island he had visited several times to collect data for a book on Theodoric the Goth, which was almost complete at the time of his death.
