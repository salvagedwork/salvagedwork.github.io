# 10,000 YEARS OF NORDIC FOLK ART

There is no shortage of major works and smaller essays concerning Nordic prehistoric and medieval art, but often the presentation of this world of images is merely an account of stylistic development, connections with contemporary European art, chronology and technique. Here we wish to take a different path, letting the images speak for themselves, accompanied only by an introduction and by the necessary facts about the depicted artworks.

This path is passable because the artist and the scholar have joined forces. Thus, the artist selects and compiles the internal connections between the images in the group to be treated, gathering these images into a continuous collage, so that they can be seen both individually and in context, while the scholar provides them with the necessary documentation.

Such a connection was already created a quarter of a century ago, when a circle of young artists and scholars published the journal *"Helhesten,"* in which they sought to demonstrate the interplay between the visual arts and other aspects of cultural life, including archaeology and ethnography.

From this collaboration arose—as on a tree—a fork, whose two branches were art and science, planted in fertile soil and with foliage from a common root.

For most of the "Helhesten" contributors this had great significance, and this continued through personal contacts to the present day, far beyond the journal's two successful years, which now belong to the greatest rarities of art history.

It is remarkable to think that the most distinctive Nordic art is not found in art museums, but in cultural history museums and out in the landscapes as monuments.

Perhaps that is why it has not hitherto been sufficiently recognized and valued.

But it is this art that the many volumes of this work shall bring to general awareness, and not only to the Nordic peoples, but to the whole world, because the universal significance of this art is self-evident.

## SKÅNE

During the centuries immediately following the birth of Christ, the Romans began little by little to learn about the adventurous lands at the northern edge of the ocean. Among the great islands they came into contact with here, one in particular, named Scandia, made a strong impression on travellers, the informants of geographers and historians, due to its fertility and as the homeland of significant peoples. That Scandia was in reality not an island but a peninsula was something they had not yet understood clearly. There is now no doubt that the Scandia they first encountered was present-day Skåne. But the name Scandia or Scandinavia, as it was sometimes written, gradually became for the Romans a designation for the entire Scandinavian peninsula, a designation that later fell into oblivion but was revived in modern times and came to encompass Denmark as well. Already a thousand years before our historical era, the contemporary cultural world's perception of Skåne thus conferred upon the province such a position that it gave its name to the entire Scandinavian North.

### *The landscape and the historical environment*

Even today, Skåne occupies a special position in several respects among other Scandinavian provinces. As the southernmost extension of the Scandinavian peninsula and an old Danish province, it constitutes an important link between the continent and the far North. The province possesses the fertile soil, the great forests, the rolling plains, and the distinctive rocky mountain ridges. But above all, Skåne possesses the sea. On three sides it is surrounded by water, and the greatest distance from one coast to the other amounts to no more than 100 km. The surrounding sea is not broad and has always been navigable. It has not been a dividing line but a connecting route open to the east, west, and south. The real boundary runs to the north in the great forests, difficult to traverse in ancient times, toward Småland and Sweden.

Skåne's natural wealth, which has always been a source of the province's prosperity, has made it coveted by neighbouring realms. The mild climate and the good soil have favoured an agriculture whose practitioners from the Stone Age to our time have been bearers of Scanian culture. The sea has provided abundant fish, which especially during the Middle Ages with the great herring fishery became a significant European trade commodity.

From ancient times the Scanian possesses a certain distinctive character, which is connected with the province's nature and general conditions. Even today there is something paradoxical in the Scanian temperament—a palpable openness to the outside world paired with thoughtfulness, sometimes suspicion toward the foreign. The Scanian is willing to make use of incoming impulses to the greatest possible extent, but in such a way that his own tradition is not lost. Entirely in accordance with this follows that his speech is often ambiguous and can still today confuse the central Swede (uppsvensken).

Through these remarkable conditions in a province that is jokingly called a realm of its own, the expressions of tradition have never been cast in a single mould. The varied landscape with its different ways of life means that Skåne cannot be grasped or described in an unambiguous way. The province's peculiarity lies precisely in the paradoxes, to which is added a certain form of ambivalence in the Scanian. He can when he wants to, but he can also let things be, when life is not threatened, a paradoxical union of energy and indolence. Spiritually, this fundamental attitude constitutes a prerequisite for active action and the shaping of form from contemplation.

That the present collection of images has been drawn solely from this province has become a natural consequence of the unified character that Skåne possesses despite its diversity. One finds the monuments preserved from a bygone epoch so densely that one often need not travel more than a few kilometres to get from one to another. In certain respects this stock of monuments differs from what is found in other parts of the North, but in its overall character it provides from a central and limited area a particularly representative picture of Romanesque Nordic stone sculpture. In time, the presented sculpture spans only somewhat more than a hundred years, from around 1100 to some way into the 13th century.

The Viking Age and the earliest Middle Ages certainly possessed an indigenous monumental stone art, but its overall character and function was fundamentally different from that of Romanesque church art. The stone sculpture of the latter proceeded from entirely new premises. It was bound to the churches and formally legitimized through its connection to the beliefs that belonged to the Christian Church. This circumstance does not, however, exclude that much was inherited. The images came into being during a time when the Christian world of ideas was still relatively new in the North. At the same time, for the individual person and their view of things and images, the transition from old to new may not have been too great. They still lived in a tangible contact with reality in which the image also constituted a palpable shaping. But this reality was not primarily restricted to the measurable in identity with the natural form. It was a reflection of the intangible and an experience of their own life in and as an expression of the contrast-filled combination of crude realism and supernatural dependence.

Skåne was during the Middle Ages the most important province among the eastern Danish territories. Already early after the Danish realm's formation during the 800s and 900s, the kings recognized the importance of being able to dominate the province. Some way into the 1000s, Canute the Great founded the town of Lund. This happened for economic-political reasons in order to benefit from trade here and to control the most important road connections in connection with one of the province's largest marketplaces. A mint grew up in the town and a number of craftsmen and merchants gathered there. This was during a time when the greater part of Skåne's population must still have been pagan. Gradually Christianity began to gain a foothold in the province, especially in Lund, where one may assume that the king had already early had a wooden church built. The missionaries and bishops who were then active in the province came for the most part from England, the westernmost part of King Canute's North Sea empire.

One can probably assume that Canute's interest in Skåne and Lund may have been dictated by his plans to make the province a central area for the realm encompassing all the North, which he strove to add to his Danish-English kingdom. The plans were, however, never fully realized, not least due to the compromise regarding the Danish Church's subordination to Hamburg-Bremen, which was the result of Canute's meeting with the Pope and the German Emperor, Conrad II, during his visit to Rome in 1027. The king's first initiatives may nonetheless have been of fundamental importance for the continued development of Skåne's position as such a power-political strongpoint in Danish national politics, primarily so long as the aspirations of the kings and the Church went hand in hand.

Already Canute the Great's father, Sweyn Forkbeard, had laid the foundation for Scanian estate acquisitions, which particularly Canute's sister Estrid developed further and may have taken refuge in. Here her son, Sweyn Estridsen, can also be imagined to have stayed during certain periods, not only during his youth but also after he had become king. As such he resumed the earlier struggle for the Danish Church's liberation from the German archbishopric. When Sweyn Estridsen established two episcopal sees in Skåne in 1060, one of them, in Lund, came to be occupied by an Englishman in accordance with the general aspirations. The other episcopal see, in Dalby just next to Lund, was however occupied by a German, Egino, who nevertheless after six years moved to Lund, after the first bishop there had died.

The episcopal see in Dalby was discontinued and the begun stone church was probably not completed until afterwards. The remains of the oldest building, the first known stone church in Skåne, are somewhat puzzling considering the initiator Sweyn Estridsen's political intentions. The austere but religiously-politically charged pillar basilica was of German type with conceptual prerequisites in Ottonian architecture. Did it stand as an expression of the king's concession to the Hamburg-Bremen archbishopric, or did it represent a visible manifestation of Sweyn's aspirations to supremacy against the German emperor and the German Church, underscored by the use of the opponent's own symbols of power? Considering the king's continued care for the church, even after it had lost its bishop and become a collegiate church, the latter alternative seems the more likely.

According to Adam of Bremen, Skåne should already in the 1070s have had around 300 churches. Whether this number is correct or merely a result of the informants' desire to impress is impossible to determine—Adam was in Denmark but probably not in Skåne. The churches that existed must, however, all have been built of wood. But after the two episcopal churches came into being, other stone churches probably gradually began to be erected as well. Neither from the oldest church in Dalby nor from the first episcopal church in Lund, known only through archaeology, has any figural sculpture been preserved.

The word Lund has for many become synonymous with its cathedral. When this during the first half of the 12th century rose without any competition over everything else the town could offer in the way of buildings, the name must have even more signified a concept for the church building and what it represented. It was hardly self-evident that the ecclesiastical centre of the North should be placed in Lund. The town does seem to have developed favourably after it was founded in the 1020s by Canute the Great, but it was after all on the periphery of the Danish realm. Already King Canute seems, however, to have attached great importance to his new creation, which especially in its Latin form could easily be confused nominally with the king's largest city in the western part of his realm, namely London. Among the many places where Canute had the first domestic Danish coin minting started, Lund has occupied the foremost place by far. Nor did the succeeding kings let production decline at the town's mint, which was probably located in close connection to the royal manor.

If Lund thus seems to have been in a vigorous economic development during the greater part of the 1000s, the town could not, however, in ecclesiastical respects during this time assert itself against certain eastern Danish towns. Skåne did not get its own bishop until 1060, and when Canute the Great's sister Estrid around 1030 built a stone church in Roskilde, which was later rebuilt into a larger one by Bishop Svend in the 1070s, in Lund one still had only stave churches available. The conditions changed again on royal initiative. In the 1080s Canute II, later the Holy, had a stone church built for himself dedicated to St. Laurentius. It was probably begun as a royal manor church, but the king transferred it to the bishop and the cathedral chapter that could come into being through his generous donations to the church.

Favoured by the Papal See's opposition to the German emperors, King Erik Ejegod and the Lund bishop Ascer finally succeeded through joint efforts in freeing the Danish Church from the supremacy of Hamburg-Bremen. This happened during the very first years of the 12th century, and in 1104 Ascer could be invested with the pallium. He thereby became not only archbishop in Denmark but also primate over the entire North. It is with great probability partly due to this institutional dignity strived for from the beginning and the thereby achieved position of power that the archiepiscopal see was placed in Lund in Skåne, the part of Denmark that had the most central location with regard to contacts with and control of the Scandinavian peninsula. In terms of ecclesiastical power politics it was the same move that Canute the Great had made for general political purposes barely a hundred years earlier, when the town of Lund was founded. When Saxo Grammaticus at the end of the century was to justify why Lund was chosen as the archiepiscopal see, he stated among other things that "from neighbouring areas one comes easily there. The roads are many by land and by water."

Archbishop Ascer came from one of the Danish magnate families of peasant stock from which both kings and bishops were recruited. The austere features of these men receive a monumental reflection in the earliest parts of Lund Cathedral, for which the first impulses were drawn from traditionally Western European quarters. The mighty crypt's oldest parts are in themselves sculpturally shaping, the image is absent, the concrete symbolic formations are, as in the sanctuary's columns, still only ornamentally expressed.

With the significance that Lund gained through the establishment of the archiepiscopal see, Skåne's history for somewhat more than a hundred years, i.e., precisely the time that the image material presented here spans, came in large part to be that of its bishops. On essential points we know this history through the written source material. But also things, and among these belongs the sculptural world, are a form of source material for knowledge of the individual person's perception of their existence. Before we try to read something from this, however, a portion of the more tangible situation shall be sketched.

In 1137 Ascer was succeeded on the archiepiscopal throne by Eskil. He seems to have been a man of an entirely different kind than his predecessor. Eskil was indeed the nephew of the latter, but in contrast to Ascer, who had mainly been oriented toward the maritime Western Europe, Eskil had an exceptionally lively contact with continental Europe. With Bernard of Clairvaux he was a close friend, and when Eskil after a life dramatic in many respects in the 1170s renounces his archiepiscopal dignity, he travels to Clairvaux, where in 1182 he ends his life. The political history in Denmark during Eskil's time was extremely confused due to the constant conflicts between changing claimants to the throne with close kinship to one another. The Church's relationship to royal power had previously been good. Eskil was a European also in the respect that as a person he came to take part in the era's great disputes between state and church. In his admittedly cautious but nonetheless attempts to assert the Church's independent position also in Denmark, he was time and again drawn into the political conflicts surrounding the kings.

But despite the troubled times, through Eskil's personal initiative a new and fruitful cultural policy developed, which laid the foundation for not least a Skåne in the European community. The cathedral was completed in a new building phase, which brought with it a rich sculptural decoration, and in 1145 the high altar could be consecrated. For the spreading of Christianity's cultural fruits, monasticism in its various forms played perhaps the most prominent role. As a monastery founder, Eskil could not be surpassed by any other Danish bishop. Before his time there existed in Skåne only one Benedictine monastery in Lund and the Dalby taken over by the Augustinian canons at the beginning of the 12th century. In self-evident accordance with his friendship with France and Bernard of Clairvaux, the archbishop introduced the Cistercians into the country, and the first monastery was founded in 1144 in Herrevad in Skåne. It was, however, another order that Eskil came to favour primarily in Skåne, namely the Premonstratensians. No fewer than four monasteries of this order he allowed to grow up, in Tommarp, Öved, Lund and Vä. It must certainly have been of great importance that the Premonstratensians, like the Cistercians, alongside their spiritual activities also had a practical orientation, but in addition for the Premonstratensian monasteries came the fact that they could be placed in a town. This became the case not only in Lund but also in Tommarp and Vä. Characteristic of this order's monasteries was also that they were directly under the bishop, which may have had a quite special significance considering that Eskil placed them at some of the economically most strategic places in the province, i.e., in connection with the towns where royal power also had interests to defend in its control over economic life.

With Archbishop Eskil, Lund and Skåne came into direct connection with French culture. This happened not only through Eskil's personal relations and travels to France but also through the newly founded orders that originated from there. The once established contact continued under the following bishops, and the French cultural influences became alongside the older heritage of essential importance for the late 12th century's intellectual flourishing.

The archdiocese of Lund's four first and most significant archbishops were quite different types from one another, each with their own prominent features. Ascer seems to have been the secure and without pretense powerful man, who with his person conveyed the old heritage to the incoming new era. Eskil was the great ecclesiastical innovator with the wide connections. His successor from 1179, Absalon, was primarily a politician both on the ecclesiastical plane and not least on the general political one. In contrast to Eskil, he stood in a directly friendly relationship to royal power, which through King Valdemar I had been stabilized already at the end of Eskil's episcopate.

As minister to the king, Absalon was at times more occupied with the realm's politics and military campaigns against the Wends in the Baltic than with the Church's affairs. It is from his time that the Scanian problems begin to emerge more concretely. The establishment of a long series of significant institutions in Skåne such as the archiepiscopal see, the monastery foundations, and also the development of towns had naturally meant a great asset for the province. But the initiators may not always have had only the province's best interests in mind. In the institutions themselves as such lay a prominent possibility for power and domination of a highly desirable province.

Of all the men we know by name and who had hitherto been active in a more prominent way within Skåne, none was a native Scanian. They came either from Jutland or, which was especially the case during Absalon's and King Valdemar's time, from Zealand. During Absalon's time, a Scanian animosity toward Zealandic rule also came directly to expression. This happened in connection with a clash between on the one side the archbishop's and the king's men and on the other the Scanian peasants at the beginning of the 1180s. The reasons for this were several. From the Scanian side one can glimpse a dissatisfaction with the constant conscriptions for the campaigns against the Wends, furthermore there was grumbling over the bishop's tithe and Absalon's demand for priestly celibacy. All these matters had had relevance already during Eskil's time, but he had proceeded cautiously and moreover not had the support of a strong royal power. The new and brusquely presented demands caused the Scanian magnates and peasants to rise up. These Scanian large peasants seem to have been of a partly different kind than the western Danish ones. They had not yet achieved the same renown and prominent position within Danish national politics as, for example, the Zealandic Hvide kinsmen. The Scanian large peasants probably lived much longer in late Viking Age traditions and defended their own local freedom. The assets from the internationally oriented cultural institutions planted throughout the province they had, however, with sound calculation availed themselves of, each within their own area. Such a situation, admittedly hypothetical but nonetheless probable, can be one of the explanations for the rare cultural manifestation, at once evenly distributed and at the same time differentiated in character, of which the epoch's sculpture is a part.

The Scanian peasants were outwardly defeated, but they were never subjugated. The Zealandic lords could, however, continue to erect new churches in the province and with associated images enrich the region and at the same time also manifest their claims. When the murder of Thomas Becket only some twenty years after it had taken place was depicted on a Scanian baptismal font, it is probably not only the saint as such who is glorified but also the bishop with the rightful claims. Since the baptismal font is in a church, Lyngsjö, which in several respects appears to have been erected by a man in the Zealandic family to which the archbishop belonged, Absalon's awareness seems to be in plain view. His involvement in another church building in the same area, N. Åsum, has been documented in the old way with a runestone erected at the church.

Admittedly the Scanians had to feel the grip of Absalon's regime firsthand, and admittedly he was primarily a national politician, but as such he succeeded during the kings Valdemar I and his son Canute VI in achieving a fruitful cooperation between the Church and the state, a cooperation which through the archbishopric in the long run also benefited Skåne. Not only the archbishop and the individual magnates but also the peasants in the parish community appear during this time to have conducted a very lively church-building activity, i.e., a replacement of the old wooden churches with stone churches, which indicates that the province during this period was favoured by a growing economic development. The direct spiritual cultivation had, however, not been disfavoured by Absalon, even though he did not continue his predecessor's intensive monastery founding. One significant monastery Absalon did, however, found in Skåne, namely the Benedictine nunnery in Bosjö. Furthermore, he brought about a reformation and uniformization of the Danish Church.

When Absalon died in 1201, he was succeeded by Andreas Sunesen. This last in the line of the archdiocese of Lund's four first and great archbishops has gone down in history as the most learned of the four. He had laid the foundation during studies in Paris, Bologna, and Oxford. In order to impart to the future priests who received their education in Lund some of the knowledge that could be acquired at the foreign universities, he composed a great didactic poem in hexameter. With the creation story as a contrapuntal motif, the Christian salvation history was described and commented upon in this. Andreas Sunesen's juridical education, acquired in Bologna, became of great benefit in an important revision and commentary to the Scanian law, through which we get a concrete picture of the Scanian peasant's life.

During the final phase of Andreas Sunesen's archiepiscopate, a new monastic order came to Skåne. Already in 1223 a place was provided for the Dominicans in Lund, from where they then spread to other towns. The introduction of different monastic orders can during these times be seen as a kind of reflection of the expanding cultural influences and the needs arising from societal development. The arrival of the mendicant friars stands here as the end of the epoch to which we devote our interest. Their presence meant that a developed urban society had been reached. The foundation for this was in Skåne laid already 200 years earlier with Lund, which was later during the 1000s followed by other inland towns such as Tommarp and Vä and Hälsingborg at the narrowest part of the sound. Under the economic-political conditions of the 12th century, new coastal towns began to grow and gain importance not only for the province's internal trade but also for the external.

Among these, Skanör and Falsterbo, located on a peninsula farthest out to the southwest, came to occupy a special position, at first and mainly not as direct urban formations, since life here was relatively seasonal, but as a great international marketplace in the important herring trade. For a couple of months annually, merchants gathered here to receive the commodity so abundantly found along the Scanian coast in exchange for their own products. Among the trading foreigners, from the end of the 12th century the Germans from the newly formed Hanseatic League came to be in the majority. German influences also affected to no small degree the development toward the organized urban society that became characteristic of the High Middle Ages, and which in Skåne began during the first half of the 13th century.

With what these towns and their bourgeoisie came to represent, something new was introduced into social life alongside the old peasant society. But all this had been prepared during the preceding century, which precisely by being a period of renewal, in constant development, came in all respects to become both economically and culturally one of Skåne's foremost golden ages. Fundamentally, the development had been carried by the old peasant society, which despite strong influences from the continent never developed into a feudal society. The free peasants had felt themselves to be of the same stock as the lords, and the consciousness of freedom, which once perhaps had expressed itself in licence, had under the influence of Christian institutions received a new direction and a new responsibility.

In their relationship to reality and the things and images that reflected it, the people of this society probably had a more uninhibited and less formally bound attitude than what would follow in the coming more bourgeois society. Dependence on things, not on the growth of the land in the rhythmically changing nature, came for the burgher gradually to mean that he preferred to see himself and his surroundings depicted according to the image of reality that was unambiguously graspable. The preceding expansive age did not usually bind the representations of sensible reality in an accepted or given form. Thereby in its pictorial art the contemporary world of ideas could be captured in a shifting multiplicity, which reflects both deep spirituality and naive directness.

It was within and in connection with the Church that the main part of monumental pictorial art came into being throughout the Middle Ages. This is especially valid for the older part of the epoch, which is also relevant in this context. The connecting link with an older and pre-Christian tradition, which may and should have existed in, for example, carved parts of the old wooden churches, has for Skåne's part been entirely lost with one exception. It is thus with the new stone church buildings that the carved image emerges. The by far most of these churches were erected in Skåne during the 12th century and are still today preserved in the hundreds.

To erect a stone church at this time was probably quite costly. There should also be no doubt that the first and also in the future the most important initiatives came from the magnates who possessed the economic means. These then regarded themselves as in some measure owners of the church building itself but at the same time also as patronus and defenders of it. This ownership status of the building was often manifested through the powerful west towers, which were as much symbols of power as practical building elements, in which, among other things, the patronus's special gallery was accommodated. But we can also from the buildings' design establish that the parish peasants themselves early began to erect their own churches. Church building as well as sculptural decoration was significantly favoured by the fact that Skåne possesses a rich natural supply of noble stone material in the sandstone and limestone quarries already exploited from the 1000s. It is almost exclusively in this material, primarily sandstone, that the presented sculptures are executed.

### The stone masters

Who the masters of Skåne's many stone sculptures were or where they came from, we have no direct information about. That the leading sculptors at the cathedral were brought from Southern Europe, probably Italy, there should be no doubt about. But therefore there is no reason to believe that the stone masters who enriched the rural churches, except in exceptional cases, would have been brought from foreign lands. Here as in other parts of Europe the main part of the sculptors during at least the earlier part of the Middle Ages were anonymous. There are, however, always exceptions, and so was also the case among the Scanian stone masters. On the tympanum field over the entrance to Ö. Herrestad church one can still clearly read the words: "Carl stenmester skar thenna sten" (Carl the stone master carved this stone). It has been generally assumed that this Carl stone master sculpted not only the stone on which the inscription is found but also the portal frame as a whole. Based on the sculptural ornamentation found around the portal, a long series of sculptures, primarily in southeastern Skåne but also in the province's central parts, have been attributed to this Carl. Even if not everything attributed to Carl can be considered to have been executed by him, we have through the signature a testimony to a stone master of certainly Nordic and probably Scanian origin. That he was allowed to affix his name to one of his works perhaps suggests that he had a local fame and enjoyed a reputation that presumably did not always come to even the most skilled artist or craftsman during this time.

Carl stone master's signature has been found only once, but there was at approximately the same time during the latter half of the 12th century also another Scanian sculptor who signed a whole series of baptismal fonts. On the rim of the bowl he has carved in runes: "Mårten (Martin) gjorde mig" (Mårten made me). Many of the baptismal fonts that can be attributed to him with the help of the signature or by stylistic means have the bowl most often only ornamentally sculpted, but it rests in many cases on lion figures characteristic of Mårten. That runes were used in the inscription is in itself not unusual. Throughout the Middle Ages it was in many cases the literate layman's normal script, primarily for shorter messages or invocations. This does not, however, exclude that the runes at the same time by tradition may have been attributed a certain magical significance. When Lund Cathedral's restorer, Adam van Duren, as late as at the beginning of the 16th century begins one of his many inscriptions carved in the cathedral with the words "Gud hjälp" (God help), these two words but only they are executed in runes.

Mårten's signature on the baptismal fonts may have had the same significance as Carl's signature, but it is probably not unlikely that he perhaps primarily with the help of the magical runes wanted to affix an invocation to the not least for this time important sacramental functional object that the baptismal font constituted. It is in this context also not insignificant that through the formulation it is the object, the font, that speaks. The stone master may have put something of his soul into the work, so that it before coming generations in connection with the sacrament of baptism would remind of him.

The third in the line of known by name Scanian stone masters was called Tove. He has, as if in passing, slipped his name in among the texts that accompany the depictions on the baptismal font in Gumlösa. His works should have been executed during mainly the 1190s. With that, our knowledge of the names of Scanian stone masters from Romanesque times is also exhausted. They have each let their names appear in different ways, perhaps from different motives. They have, however, one thing in common, namely the Nordic names, which clearly state that it was now the country's own artists who most diligently helped to not only decorate but also give a symbolic meaning to the province's parish churches with their sculptures. In a review of the images the reader soon finds that most reproduce baptismal fonts or details thereof. This seemingly quantitative predominance for a certain object group is not accidental. In the Scanian countryside the richest and in several respects most interesting early medieval stone art is manifested primarily on the fonts. There is probably also no country in Europe where within a specific area such a multitude of Romanesque baptismal fonts has been preserved as in Skåne and on Gotland.

We can establish that there were workshops that produced a long series of similar fonts, but just as evident despite this is the diversity of the shifting types one encounters. They speak of an unfettered activity with shifting impulses, while at the same time being in possession of a striking originality in relation to the stock from the rest of Europe. This originality reveals itself not only in the forms but also in the diverse and rich world of images we encounter on them.

From an art historical viewpoint, what is meant by the concept of Romanesque style has been clarified. There is no doubt that the Scanian stone sculpture presented here belongs to this stylistic group. It differs, however, at the same time from much of the pictorial art that from the same epoch is found elsewhere and is thereby easily recognizable if it is encountered exported outside Skåne's own borders. Paradoxically enough, it is, however, not a common Scanian stylistic feature that makes the strongest impression, but the palpable stylistic differences between the various Scanian stone masters and workshops. It is in this diversity that the artistic richness lies. It is remarkable to what degree the individual master here independently and naturally has found his bearings with both subject and form, while elsewhere one can now and then find how this art can have acquired a certain stereotypical stamp. If the Scanian Romanesque stone sculpture displays its own face, it is primarily in this richness of variation that gives it its peculiar place within the epoch's European art. The technique and not least the craftsmanship played a great role in the medieval practice of art, it also lies as the foundation for a number of the works presented here, but it is nevertheless throughout primarily the artist behind the works who has made them speak to us. The current receptivity to this may to some extent have its basis in our era's personality-oriented conception of art, but only as the introduction to an acquaintance; ultimately and with greater validity it is the humility behind the creation that makes the experience of the images become reality.

Stone sculpture has for natural reasons, in contrast to art objects of more perishable material, had a greater possibility of being preserved to our days. This does not, however, prevent that what we today can still admire and enjoy is only a part of what once existed. During the Middle Ages itself, one seems to a large extent to have preserved older sculptures in connection with rebuildings of the parts in which the images had originally been placed. They have been inserted into later masonry, perhaps lost their original symbolic function but possibly received a new one, but above all they must have been appreciated as image. What the Reformation in the North meant for the pictorial art in the churches we do not yet know enough about. For the common man, however, it probably was not too great an adjustment in the relationship to things and the image. With one exception, Skåne was also spared from the iconoclasm that went so destructively across certain parts of Europe. More fateful for the medieval churches and their furnishings became the 18th century and a large part of the 19th century. During the latter century, prosperity and wealth in certain districts became a direct cause of the destruction of medieval churches in connection with the building of new and larger churches. Many sculptures were dispersed during this time, baptismal fonts were used as flower pots in gardens, other sculptures disappeared entirely, but some were left lying in secluded places. From there they were retrieved at the beginning of this century, when a new understanding and a new interest began to awaken for the old treasures. What was then collected from destroyed churches in Skåne is today preserved in Lund University Historical Museum. Today not only the sculptures preserved at the museum but everything that exists in connection with the still living old churches is protected through the cultural heritage law.

## THE WORLD OF IMAGES

The modern person's attitude toward art would surely have been entirely foreign to the medieval viewer. This is not to say that what we call an aesthetic experience could not in itself have been excluded. But it has not been consciously perceived by the medieval person as an isolated intrinsic value. Art's value was on the one hand connected with the kind of craftsmanship with which the work was executed and on the other hand with the degree of vivification and the capacity for experience that the image could evoke. The aesthetic norm has under such circumstances not a formal character but is part of the work's shaping of the expression that was to be a vivification of the person's situation in the present and in eternity.

The main part of the Romanesque stone art that we find here shall therefore primarily be experienced as more or less eloquent expressions of the contemporary person's relation to and perception of the immediate reality in which they lived. We will encounter a narrative art at once ambiguous and straightforward in varying forms, sometimes unfettered and naively immediate and sometimes disciplined and laboriously ornate in its striving to please the existing fashion. At the same time we must be aware that nothing came into being merely in play, nothing was executed for its own sake or as an outlet merely for the stonecutter's will to manifest a forming. Even the simple and naive had for contemporary people a meaning, which in its immediacy also speaks to us and thereby constitutes evidence of unpretentiousness's possibilities of finding and shaping an expression for feeling and experience. Let us try, to the extent we can free ourselves from normative form and expression patterns, to at first regard the image as it in itself appears in order to still convey the experience of reality that had validity then but existentially also now.

In the human figure we often encounter a trait of melancholy seriousness. As a kind of admonishing basic trait, this comes to expression primarily through the image of Christ. This seriousness can in the strongly stylized form feel like a penetrating loftiness or like a somewhat sullen severity. We are captivated by this sculpture's direct address to us primarily through the images in which Christ is enthroned and with his eyes fixes the viewer. In depictions of the baptism, on the other hand, Christ is certainly frontally directed toward us but is at the same time in a peculiar way passive toward the viewer and also the action that is taking place, since it is the action as a whole that has significance. A remarkable exception we find in a baptism scene in which John the Baptist for a moment, forgetful of his holy task, stares astonished at the viewer, not merely appealingly but with an uninhibited curiosity that has also infected Christ. He has thereby broken his isolation toward the viewer, not to summon him but to wonder at his presence. As a prerequisite for this our interpretation of the scene there certainly lies no consciousness on the part of the stone master who executed the image. It is rather the simple and humanly immediate in his perception of the event that makes us experience this effect. On the same baptismal font there is a depiction of the three holy kings, who in the same way seem to be more interested in us than in the child they are advancing to pay homage to.

The contact between on the one hand the figure or scene and on the other the viewer has thus been achieved with different means of expression but is in most cases palpably present. When a person wants to direct our attention to themselves or what they want to say, it most often happens through a gesture or by means of the widely opened eyes that do not want to let us escape. But we also find examples of how an intimate contact can be achieved through an almost frivolous inscrutability reflected in the facial features.

The contrasts we also find in the narrative scenes' action. A dignified and measured solemnity meets us primarily in the New Testament's Passion scenes but also in the praise scenes in connection with Jesus's birth history, but in the actual birth scenes the viewer immediately becomes more engaged. The pensive Joseph invites us in quiet contemplation to take part in the miracle in the grotto, if not as irreverently intrusively as the donkey and the ox, then with the eagerness and joy that characterize the shepherds and their animals.

Directly into people's lives certain stone masters have gone in their depiction of the Fall and its consequences. Here one encounters the direct identification between viewer and pictorial figure, without doubt a palpable experience for the medieval viewer but with an address also to us, if we are sensitive enough to perceive it. With an ill-concealed calculation Eve receives the fruit from the serpent, and Adam sinks his teeth into it with an uninhibited, almost bestial desire. When the couple then works the earth outside the garden of paradise, the sullen Adam looks uncomprehending and questioning at Eve, who with a half vulgar grin seems to be content with the new situation. On another baptismal font she shows herself more modest, where she sits somewhat bored but proud with her spindle. Adam, on the other hand, is entirely weighed down not only by the carpentry work he is engaged in but primarily by the sorrow that his remorse-bought expression conveys.

The body in and of itself the Romanesque stone master had no interest in. When the difference between the naked Adam and Eve is to be depicted, it is not through the sex but by means of the length of the hair. The costume, however, can often be carefully executed, since it in most cases characterizes the persons and regarding the extras consists of the era's own garments, whether the events took place over a thousand years ago, without ties to time, or in close connection with the stone master's own time. In this way the viewer experienced the depicted events as current and palpably present. But the costume can also be freely shaped and through its ornamental form give a certain chord as the basis for the emotional mood that the figure or scene is intended to reflect. When old Simeon in the temple gets to see and touch the infant Jesus, the figures as a whole are characterized by a quiet dignity, but the movement that the event arouses can palpably be followed in the schematically drawn soft wave movements, which starting from Mary's cloak and over the infant Jesus's swaddling clothes become a swirl over Simeon's left side. A solemnity, a transformation of the figures into symbols of dignity for the action they perform is achieved on the other hand by the large and summarily sculpted cloaks in which the three holy kings are depicted on a baptismal font. In the following image with the same motif one can notice how the sculptors at the end of the epoch with an intrusive will toward objective realism and at the same time a deeper relief instead achieved a naive identification—the sublimely universal is gone.

Together with the costume, the bodies beneath, only thought or sensed, often constitute a rhythmic ornament to shape a movement as with the three Marys at Christ's tomb. To emphasize the warm sense of belonging between Mary and Elisabeth at their meeting, the sculptor has let the bodies unite in a large form. Here we can also see what happens when the sculptural naturalism increases; through the distance between the figures the emotional shaping can be observed, but in the earlier relief's art of expression it is felt.

The couples who on the baptismal font in Tryde embrace each other let us perceive their belonging through yet another means, the gesture, which is one of the era's most important bearers of expression. The long and slender arms, which were executed without the slightest pretension to anatomical truth, wind around the figures, bind them to each other, while the hands only suggest a tender gesture. In the overdimensioning of the arm and hand movements the dramatic course of events often lies gathered. So is the case in the interplay of hands which in a depiction of the creation of Adam signifies the actual happening. The gesture can also be of a purely attributive character. In a naive form we experience how an angel, set to guard the gate to the heavenly Jerusalem, with childlike eagerness holds forth his key with a palpably elongated arm.

What in the human figures primarily appeals to the viewer is the head, often enlarged but gathering in itself all the power that the figure is to express, whether this power is of an active character or filled with contemplation and seriousness. With a certain accompaniment of the hands' gestures, the scene's expressive power in the depicted Last Supper scene lies gathered in the faces. Even in the strong stylization the different characters and the varying emotional moods that control the actors are perceived. Here as in most other human depictions it is the eyes that most intensively convey the contact both between the figures acting within the image and between these and the viewer. The latter is true even in the cases where the formal simplification has been driven to its extreme.

Even more intensively the expressive power in the human face meets us when it isolated and freestanding projects from the portals' capital rows or the baptismal fonts' bases. Most often it is then hardly a human being anymore, even though the image has borrowed their form. We instead stand before a concrete embodiment of the demons that have taken possession of the human being, and which through the clearly stated malice in the angry eyes, the gnashing teeth, and the protruding chin are intended to ward off the evil they themselves embody.

Licentiousness wells from the gaping jaw of the personified vice, just as sensual voluptuousness makes Luxuria's face swell as she suckles the serpents. The personified vices are not formally restrained, they are consumed by their own depravity. The indeterminate demons, on the other hand, who in an unguarded moment can creep up on us, are often held fast by arms that pull at the face's moustaches, the twisted rope that folk belief saw as a magical fetter. In formal terms the distance is not so great between the idol that once on the church's wall warded off evil attacks from its pagan fellows, and the pious bishop who received the people at the entrance to the same church. But through the rustic power in the face pressed down between the shoulders in the one case and the stately dignity in the bishop's face in the other, it is nevertheless representatives of two different worlds that meet us. For the contemporary viewer these two worlds were extremely real and at once present, not only side by side but sometimes also in one and the same figure. When the human being had lent their form to the demon or the devil, then their ears grew out like horns.

But it was primarily in the form of monsters or fabulous beasts that evil confronted the viewer. A belief in the devilry behind things could probably have achieved a palpable concretization in the encounter with the enormous jaw that threateningly stretches toward the viewer, while at the same time the coiling and forward-whipping tail of the malevolent monster gives emphasis to the devious intention to devour a wavering soul. The devil in person, when he is to help Simon Magus jump from the tower, looks almost ridiculously harmless in comparison with the figures he has taken possession of. A grotesque figure he makes as imprisoned and defeated, but when he in the form of the lion or the monster between his enormous jaws crushes the harmless lamb or with serpents as helpers is in the process of devouring a human being, it happens in the powerful sculptural form with such intensity that he thereby binds and averts his own power but at the same time constitutes a warning sign for the viewer. With a sideways glance at his helpless victim, he makes the viewer experience the event not merely as a one-time occurrence but as something that happens now.

But not even all monsters need be bearers of evil. The lion especially can also represent the opposite, and above all with its powerful figure it gets to embody strength when it carries the columns on which the church rests. If the horror presses upon us from the animals that were unknown and dangerous to humans, we encounter all the more charm and almost lovableness in the depiction of the animals that humans surrounded themselves with and that were their friends. In this respect the horse, as the contemporary person's indispensable servant on many occasions, occupies the foremost place. The three wise men come riding to Bethlehem on their stately chestnuts, and when the holy family fled to Egypt, the Nordic stone master could not imagine that it would have been on a donkey but placed Mary and the child on a magnificent horse, which worthily and safely carries them away from Herod's murderous designs. The close belonging between the horse and its master is depicted with a for the time quite unusual, almost lyrical empathy. Behind the kneeling Eustachius his horse assumes an elegant compliance in its movement, which makes one directly confronted with the contemporary's apparently strong attachment to their indispensable animal. The sympathy can in the freer sculpture take expression in an almost welded together form between rider and horse.

As with the horse, it is many times palpable with what precision things are depicted. It also happens in close connection with contemporary conditions. If a ship appears, it conforms with its animal-headed stems closely to the indigenous tradition's Viking ship. The event the ship depicts or the symbolic function it possesses thereby becomes more immediately present. The same applies to the period-typical garments of both everyday, military, royal, or liturgical cut. The individual objects that directly state something about the situation's significance have been clearly emphasized. After Adam and Eve were driven from paradise and forced to hard labour, Adam has had to start swinging the heavy carpenter's axe and Eve spin the wool with her spindle, occupations with which the viewer was completely familiar, and which made him or her identify their own situation with that of the oldest ancestors. But the tool has been emphasized also to stand as a sign for actions of a less everyday kind, for actions of decisive significance in the Christian salvation history. With the raised sword King Herod utters his command for the massacre of the innocents in Bethlehem. The rope with which Christ, bound, is led before Pilate appears with greater sharpness and verisimilitude than the acting figures' bodies. The hammer and the nail in the hand of the man at Christ's cross serve primarily not in a concrete action; Christ is already nailed to the cross, indeed he is already dead, Longinus has just been struck by the water and blood radiating from Christ's side wound, the hammer and nail are held by a human being like any other, who still participates in Christ's nailing to the cross.

In everything the Romanesque stone art we stand before here has a meaning and significance beyond the objective depiction. The ornamentation itself is not only or perhaps not even primarily decorative but shapes symbolically supernatural concepts. The palmettes and vine tendrils on the baptismal fonts' bowls recall the life-giving water. The closed ring chain from a chancel screen is the image of eternity in which everything is linked and with which life in the form of the palmette is connected. For safety's sake a holy man points with an admonishing gesture at the abstract image while at the same time his eyes directed straight at us draw our attention to him.

Everything that the Romanesque stone sculptor has depicted has a religious anchoring in the broadest sense. The ability to experience the Christianity that had not been established in the area for much more than a hundred years as a reality bound to the present and to things probably did not involve too great difficulties for the people whose not too distant ancestors in pagan times stood in an often palpable relationship to the powers they believed they saw and experienced in nature and its orders. Now the signs had changed and the essential direction of human striving had become different. But the experienced force of both good and evil's concrete presence was just as tangible. We have seen how in details one could through the image be placed in direct confrontation with the holy or diabolical things. In the scenes as a whole the identification was not as strong, their purpose was demonstrating, narrating, establishing, but the artist has not objectively freed himself from what he depicts. In the details one experiences this. With a religious motivation in his choice of images, the stone master has seldom depicted current actions. On some rare occasion it has happened, as in the baptism scene that appears on a font. But the scene's action is purely liturgical and it is directly bound to the object that is used. But with the scene's presence, those participating at the baptism are tied in a direct way to the sacramental act.

Among biblical depictions it is primarily the story of Adam and Eve, especially their work, that may have had an identificatory effect on the viewer. Otherwise it is primarily the non-biblical scenes that may have appealed to the viewer and their own situation. Not least this may be the case if the instructive scenes moreover seem to have a connection to old Nordic values. The perception of the more or less honourable way of dying can possibly be reflected in a difficult-to-interpret scene. On the bowl of a baptismal font one finds on either side of a ship two death scenes. On the right side a man who dies the hero's death, the martyr's death, and whose soul is carried to heaven by an angel, on the left side a man who seems to die the death considered ignoble in the Old Norse conception in a "sickbed" (sotsäng). The post with the ram's head behind the bed also reveals that his soul in the form of a small naked human is not, as in the former case, carried upward but to a lower realm of the dead. A gravity-laden melancholy characterizes the co-actors, but primarily the little sorrowful soul, who with head tilted appeals to the viewer to consider their life. Thematically the scenes certainly refer directly to specific motifs that have been lost to us, and that perhaps for the contemporary viewer were also unknown. But what happens had through its grouping in relation to other clearer symbolic depictions on the font a palpable connection to a prevailing world of ideas.

If all these images still make a strong impression on us by activating our feeling and imagination, how much more intensely shall they not then have affected contemporary people. In their meagre everyday environment, the stone sculpture must in itself have been something enormous, and in addition came that it served as a material embodiment of what many today want to call ideas and powers, but which medieval people experienced as reality.

### The significance function

It is probably natural that baptism was of fundamental importance in people's religious understanding during a time when Christianity was relatively young, and when the struggle with the pagan powers was still alive. Herein we see the explanation for why such rich artistic activity came to expression in the decoration of the many baptismal fonts with their shifting and intensely engaging world of images. We can hardly escape that many of the horrifying animals on the fonts' bases represent the powers of evil, even if other fonts in corresponding places may have been decorated with heavenly representatives. The fauna and the life that here develops before our eyes is in many respects difficult to interpret, and many figures will perhaps for all time brood over their secrets.

On the fonts' bowls we encounter seemingly more easily comprehensible depictions. They are in most cases understandable in their details, but we want to know what they innermost intend to shape.

All the scenes that depict Jesus's baptism in the River Jordan constitute an easily explained depiction of the baptismal act's historical prototype. In Bjäresjö church one encounters instead an image of baptism that goes entirely beyond the historical depiction. Jesus sits in a chalice-shaped baptismal font and holds in his right hand a cross. On his right side stands John the Baptist and on his left the Virgin Mary, who holds something that should be interpreted as a long wax candle. Here is depicted not only baptism but also death on the cross and with the candle, the Easter night liturgy's sign, resurrection to the heavenly paradise, which is summarized in the rosette above Christ's head. Here it is not primarily a matter of recalling a biblical event but of contemplating a mystery—that we through baptism shall die in order to rise again with Christ.

Constantly we are placed before this concentrated symbolism in contemplating the oldest medieval images. Clearly and expressively the events of Maundy Thursday night are rolled out before our eyes on the font in Löderup, but when the depiction comes to the culmination of events we see an image that is no longer narrative in a positive sense but which has gathered in itself a significance beyond time and space. The cross hovers over Golgotha, it is borne in the roundels by the figures that at once represent the four evangelists and their testimony and the four beings that shall be seen together with Christ at his return. The individual person's participation with Christ is represented by Longinus, who after he with his lance pierced Christ's side was struck by the streaming blood and water—the water of baptism.

In few places and during few times have artists in an immediate and dignified form so succeeded in rendering their faith in a mystical belonging, formed by the concrete narrative, existentially perceived in the sacramental belonging and standing under the sign that shall also form the final completion of baptism, Christ's return in his majesty over the throne already prepared for him.

The enthroned Christ is a main motif that is found on a number of fonts and shows the baptismal symbolism's incorporation into an eschatological context. This is a typical feature in the older Middle Ages' sacramental symbolism, which often lets parts of the doctrine of salvation be placed in relation to the comprehensive whole that is pictorially shaped by Christ's final return. The possibility of resurrection that the baptized can partake of at this occasion we can perhaps find expressed through the person who on the base of the font in Saxtorp lifts his hands toward the image of Christ that probably originally was found above, but which through the bowl's rotation has come to a different place.

As common as it is to find within the older font groups abundant elements of often difficult-to-interpret symbolic depictions, just as often one encounters among the younger fonts a seemingly more unified and more easily understandable world of images. This certainly does not mean that the images, if they are not direct depictions of baptism, would lack a symbolic connection to it. The often occurring continuous depictions from Jesus's birth history are an example of this. Surely the images have had the task of being a direct reminder of the mysteries of Christmas, but their intimate connection with the baptismal font should primarily be seen against the background of the understanding of baptism as a rebirth. This rebirth of the individual person happens through participation in Christ, and in a simple and tangible way this participation has with the help of the image been able to be connected with Jesus's own birth. In the same way we can perhaps find the double task in the images that depict scenes from the creation story. Earlier it was mentioned how not least these perhaps through their formal character, through the identification, should have been able to bring about a palpable contact between the viewer and themselves. But ultimately this contact should then lead to an awareness that creation here stands as a symbolic reference to the creation to new life that baptism effects.

But it is not only the fonts narrating with the help of figures that shape the symbolic trains of thought that are connected with the sacrament of baptism. Also those decorated only ornamentally can probably be documented with such references. Palmettes and rosettes have surely come into being not only to decorate the bowls. Their significance as the heavenly paradise has perhaps through convention gradually fallen into oblivion, but was certainly originally conscious. Indeed, perhaps the four-spoked wheel that we find on a font is a direct reference to the four rivers of paradise, which in baptismal symbolism are directly connected with the baptismal water. In many cases perhaps also the four animal or human heads occurring on the bases are to be interpreted in this direction. That the sculptural world of images on the fonts' bases has not always shaped the defeated evil is clearly apparent from figures that are unambiguous representatives of prominent persons in the heavenly paradise. We find Abraham with the blessed in his bosom, Mary as the foremost intercessor before the child she holds in her lap, and the apostles Peter and Paul.

It is, however, not only the theological-symbolic profundity that comes to expression in the world of images. A contact with the human condition we can possibly see established through the manifesting depictions of partly "propagandistic" character. The saint's legend in Tryde possibly has such a task in a religious respect, the murder of Thomas Becket furthermore with a political ulterior motive, and the during a certain period often occurring depiction of Peter in Christ's immediate proximity with a religious-political reference.

From this remarkable richness of motifs and shifting expression-shaping in connection with a single type of object, the font, we get an indication of the contemporary understanding of baptism as something enormously essential. Not only with the fundamental significance it has in conventional Christian understanding but beyond that also as a purely materialized sacramental act, through which the whole person not only in a spiritual but also in a bodily sense became united with Christ, the new ruler, to whom also the king devoted his homage and adoration, when it so pleased him.

The church building was according to medieval understanding not merely a place of worship but a dwelling of God, which thereby became a symbol of the heavenly Jerusalem. To this Christ is the gate, and consequently the entrance to the church could also refer to Christ. It could in various forms happen directly or with reference to various beliefs that were to awaken the one entering to an awareness of taking a stand in the struggle for the good. It is for this reason that the earliest architectural sculpture is primarily developed in and around the portal.

Around the portals of many of the continental great church buildings one often finds the entire symbolic dialectic expressed in a many times elegant but sometimes almost coolly intellectual way. But where does one find the central Christian mysteries concentratedly depicted with such simplicity and immediately human-near eagerness as in the tympanum field over the portal of the little early medieval church in Linderöd, in the forest tracts of central Skåne. Against a moving and partly chaotic throng, Christ appears as the crowned king. He rules from the cross before which he stands. He is the gate, but precisely because of all that takes place around him. In the left corner we find the birth and in the right the defeated Satan, defeated through the cross, from which Christ here rises and returns to on the last day separate the evil from the good. Before this eschatological vision the viewer stands before the hope of being on Christ's right side together with, among others, the bishop who, risen again, offers his praise with the gesture that in the mass accompanies the preface's praise.

In most cases the tympanum field has displayed a depiction of Christ between the princes of the apostles, Christ as Agnus Dei or represented by his Old Testament prototype Samson, or else one finds symbolic animal images, which no longer seem to have the direct reference to the portal's significance mentioned above. When two griffins on a tympanum in Gråmanstorp reach toward a tree standing in the middle, it can be the soul that longs for the fruits from the tree of life. Over the opposite portal in the south, two large animals have with a leash been bound to the tree's trunk, and from the animals' mouths issue plant tendrils. Here they have become partakers of the life-giving tree, which from originally standing in the Garden of Eden became Christ's cross to finally symbolize Christ himself. This positive interpretation is not as easy to apply to the commonly occurring motifs with the large lion that devours an animal or a human being. Is it evil that warns the one entering, or is it Christ in the lion's form that defeats Satan? The question must remain unanswered, as in the cases where a lion from a portal frame carries a human head between its opened jaws. Is it the devil who devours a human being body and soul, or is it the realm of the dead that for resurrection and judgment returns a soul?

## LUND CATHEDRAL

The medieval archiepiscopal church in Lund was not only at its creation but is still the foremost Romanesque church building in the North and of international significance as well. The archiepiscopal see established around 1104 constituted the prerequisite for its creation. The expanded liturgical function placed increased demands on a larger church, but the building was also to assert and manifest as a visible sign the new position that the episcopal see would come to occupy. The construction of the new archiepiscopal church seems to have been started immediately. We know fairly well how the work progressed through the fortunate circumstance that a contemporary calendar, included in the manuscript Necrologium Lundense, has been preserved to our time, in which notes have been made about the oldest altar consecrations. In 1123 thus the high altar in the crypt was consecrated to the honour of John the Baptist, all patriarchs and prophets. The magnificent crypt space beneath the upper church's sanctuary, choir, and transept was not thereby in its entirety finished. It became so only with the consecration of the altar in the south side chapel. This happened in 1131, and in the mention of this it is moreover said that the relics from the old church were transferred to the new crypt altar. This meant that Canute the Holy's church had been allowed to remain standing in the place where the new archiepiscopal church's nave was to be raised, until the crypt could be taken into use as a complete church space.

Through a death notice in the Necrology we also know the name of the master builder who led the work on the church's planning and earliest construction. He was called Donatus and is termed at once both architect and construction manager, two titles which taken together reveal that the man was in possession of no small competence. The part of the church that was planned and raised under his direction is characterized by a simple but powerful and harmonious architecture. Sculptural decoration occurred only exceptionally during this phase, from which still primarily the crypt but also the westernmost part of the nave remains. The lower parts of the tower section, which were probably erected at the same time, were unfortunately torn down entirely to the foundation during the 19th century when the present towers came into being. Naturally there was no indigenous tradition for the construction of a building of this magnitude, but the impulses were drawn from outside. They seem to have come from the areas around the English Channel, the regions with which Denmark had traditionally been in contact through its Norman kinsmen.

After the once so stately cathedral in the modern environment has lost something of its earlier more clearly prominent elevation, it is, apart from the crypt, not primarily the architecture from this first building phase that today gives the cathedral its distinctive character and much of its fame. It has instead to a large extent become the rich sculptural world, which admittedly somewhat decimated but nonetheless abundantly represented meets one's gaze in most places inside the church and around the medieval entrances. These sculptures make Lund Cathedral a unique monument in northern Europe, a monument to the Romanesque stone masters' craftsmanship, to an imagination to symbolically shape supernatural forms of presence, and to an internationalism that under the church's protection was not hindered by any geographical distances.

During the 1130s the new phase in the church's building history can be thought to have begun, during which the architecture came to be adorned with this sculpture of closest to Italian origin. It was during the same decade that Donatus died but also Archbishop Ascer.

Despite the bitter power-political conflicts, the work on the cathedral nevertheless continued under the successor Eskil. The older plan was not changed but certain modifications were made in the church's elevation. The most essential change, however, became the sculpture now appearing in all important places in the building. On 1 September 1145 Archbishop Eskil could thus consecrate the upper church and its altar to the honour of the Virgin Mary and Saint Laurentius. In the two side chapels' altar titles, the church's patron saints came as flanking attendants to have the two deacon saints Vincentius and Stephanus, who in turn were assisted by one warrior saint each, Vincentius by the English Albanus and Stephanus by the Moor Mauritius, all through their relics present in the southern and northern altars respectively. This well-thought-out representation was a real expression of the church's central role as the North's most important priestly church, characterized through the deacon's office and protected by the holy warriors, and all gathering around the Holy Virgin.

As a building, the cathedral was not finished with the consecration of the high altar in 1145; one of the above-mentioned side altars, the one in the north, was moreover not consecrated until the following year. The completion of the nave's easternmost part, the place on which the older church from the 1000s had still stood in 1131, probably did not take place until the end of the 12th century. But during the decades immediately before and after the middle of the century, the main part of the sculptural decoration was surely created and the apse exterior completed. Even if quite a few sculptures must be considered to have been lost over time, most from this period remains. Most are in their originally intended places such as the images around the preserved portals and the capitals in the nave, but much has also had to change place. Here belong, for example, the distinguished lion and seraph sculptures in the north transept as well as the reliefs now in the cathedral museum. Where these were originally located can be difficult to determine, but it is possible that they were intended for the interior of the church and marked the entrance to the most holy, to the sanctuary. It is also possible that it was already Archbishop Absalon who had them moved to their present places in the north transept in connection with a reformation of the cathedral that he undertook in 1187. This would mean that the images were connected with a liturgy that was then abandoned but at the same time their expressive value was so appreciated that they were allowed to perform a new service in the church. It is perhaps no coincidence that they then received their place in the church space that evidently served as the archbishop's special chapel.

The appreciation for the church's Romanesque sculpture has in large part been alive during the greater part of the Middle Ages, probably not so much due to an aesthetic evaluation of it as a certain form of ability to identify the concepts it shapes. Once the recognition ceases, however, interest and care for the images also slackens. Already during the late Middle Ages, ornaments and sculptures that were in the way of necessary building modifications were thus probably removed without concern. There can, however, hardly have been any question of active destruction. One could imagine that, in analogy with what happened in certain places on the continent, such devastation would have occurred with the Reformation. The cathedral was fortunately spared from this but nevertheless went to meet a several-hundred-year period of decline. The neglect cannot, however, be termed a destruction but should rather be regarded as a result of the building's changed function. From having been the North's most prominent episcopal and collegiate church in connection with the European church community, it changed to primarily a parish church in a nation-state without too lively contacts with European church life. Under such circumstances certain parts of the church space ceased to function, parts that had from the beginning been of prominent liturgical significance, pictorially concretized through the sculpture. This then at best acquired a curiosity value, as deterrent memories from a superstitious time.

After Skåne and Lund in 1658 became Swedish, the town and the church came to be even more isolated from the surrounding world, and toward the end of the 18th century the lack of understanding came to take active expression. One began to chip away at certain of the figures and had a serious proposal for the entire apse's demolition. Fortunately the chipping was stopped and the demolition was prevented at the last moment. During the 19th century the church underwent two major and very thorough restorations. They occurred partly in a spirit of a newly awakened romantic feeling for medieval art. This did not in itself mean an understanding of its specific character but nevertheless contributed to an appreciation that laid the foundation for continued study. When the church today again stands newly restored, we believe ourselves at the same time to harbour a greater and more real appreciation of the sculpture's artistic values and to sense something small of its hidden significance.

In its Nordic environment the cathedral sculpture fascinates the viewer. In large part it is a strange bird here, but one soon discovers how it, due to a transformation during the decades of its creation around the middle of the 12th century, contains much of universality but also hints of local originality. If one sees the sculptures taken together, as one can view them in the images, one discovers even more the rich nuances, and that something happens. It is not primarily a matter of a stylistic occurrence but of a movement outside time and space, a shaping of the inner tensions that generated the image and conditioned its belonging with the building.

In reality it is difficult to even become aware of the small relief with Adam and Eve, which in a tympanum field sits over the north aisle portal. But in the image reproduced here we see what happens. The summary "paper dolls" themselves tell about the moment when they imposed upon themselves and us the human conditions. Eve eats of the fruit and without enthusiasm reaches a piece to Adam, who with a pat on his stomach seems to have already felt the bittersweet sweetness; or has he become aware of his nakedness, which he with his hand tries to hide. It is characteristic that it is the excusing and woman-accusing Adam who turns toward the viewer, while Eve turns away from him. Everything happens at once and in the same movements of two figures who are not static but find themselves in both rest and movement. Adam's head and upper body are fixed in their frontality, but with his legs he runs. The figures do not move in a space or toward a goal, they float, indeed almost swim in the background to which they are bound, and which constitutes their sphere of existence in eternity. The depiction is universal by being naively alive and free from stylistically or tectonically normated conditions.

This unfetteredness and freedom toward the outwardly ordering principles is an exception among the figural sculptures in the cathedral. From an architectural context the plastic human image grows forth. As atlantes the powerful figures in the south aisle serve as bearers of the weight that one of the vault's transverse arches imposes on them. They replace the Corinthian capital's volutes but have overcome the abstract tectonic form through their figurality and the degree of activity they give expression to by supporting themselves against a lower wreath of acanthus leaves, the only remaining remnant of the antique plant capital.

This sculpture still sits in its original place and still takes part in the overall function for which it was originally intended. Unfortunately this is not the case with the image of the enthroned Christ and an archangel, which are kept in the cathedral museum. What place they and yet another but now vanished archangel originally occupied in the church is not entirely certain. The ignorance of this also makes the immediate interpretation of the figures more difficult, not the interpretation of what they represent but of their significance-related function. The overall effect has been lost. But still the Christ figure steps forth as a plastic realization from the background's eternity sphere. In the incarnate God's form the human image has freed itself from the surface-bound shadow world in which Adam and Eve lived, freed itself from the tectonic constraint that conditioned the two atlantes' existence in the aisle capital, and taken bodily form in order to equally summon forth the holy figures that surrounded it. The existing colour fragments give an indication of the radiance that once emanated from the figure. Then the eyes too have been alive and lent the figure resting in form full activity, not the physical movement's activity but the spiritual efficacy's, limitless in the dimension of eternity from which the image also as form-creation rises.

The same paradoxical union of spiritual movement and exalted rest characterizes the seraphs that probably once surrounded Christ and the archangels. Through the covering wings they possess a self-containedness, a self-containedness that corresponds to their function in the heavenly host closest around the throne, only there constantly present and praising but not, like Christ and his archangels, present and intervening in the world. We find not only a contrast in this solemn rest versus the flaming movement of pure spirituality that the wings can sometimes convey, but also a paradox in the circumstance that these beings without contact with time and space seemingly appear in more palpably plastic form than the relief-bound figures. This more or less fully sculptural character has, however, in Romanesque sculpture a remarkable ability to isolate the figures, to let them not only motionally but also ideally become static in their own self-containedness. Not so with the relief image, which derives its formal and ideal condition of existence from the background of active eternity sphere, which is also conveyed to the viewer. In connection with the Christ image and the archangel, one perceives the religiously graspable force from which the figures themselves rise, and which they are an embodiment of. But the background sphere can also be mysterious and ungraspable, a dwelling place for powers and potential forces, existing in themselves as well as in the viewer. An embodiment of this one finds in the springer frieze at the northern descent to the crypt. Lions, dragons, and serpents merge into each other, they transform into shifting forms while they intertwine, step in uncontrollable movements forth from the dark background, take plastically graspable form and return into the obscurity from which they came.

What was really intended with the magnificent sculpture ensemble that we find above the north chapel we do not know, but a study of the image details' relational conditions lets us sense an inner coherence. Under the enthroned cherub, humans and animals have entered the world. The anxious human couple embrace each other awkwardly but protectively, and at their feet two lions watch as representatives of the animals. The small figures have been given graspable plastic form in space. They exist as palpable sculptural units. They also exist in the world, but just as the free Romanesque sculpture is self-contained, the human couple and their animals are isolated in the now that is their existence in the world. This momentary making-present is, however, not final. Over and around the free sculpture group arches a bow with a broad relief band, in which the natural creation has gone toward its completion. In the artfully plaited tendril, from which lily-palmettes, leaves, and life-giving grape clusters issue, are inserted and as woven in a pattern four-footed animals, birds, and a small human. They no longer represent the earthly figures whose image they have borrowed but the blessed souls in the heavenly paradise. The flat figures move in a pierced interlace in which the tendrils' rhythmic repetition of meeting and returning gives the impression of constant life. The figures and the plant tendrils do not seem attached to the dark background but rather rest in it, but also rise from it and derive their existence from the varying dim light that transforms the tactile background into a sphere of spiritual dimension.

These images like Christ and the angel figures were once located in close connection with the church space's central part, around and before the high altar. Just as certain parts of the liturgy in this place were a sacramental making-present, the images constituted symbolic shapings of the supersensible's forms of existence. The depictions around the inner core that the altar formed were characterized by peacefulness and solemnity. If we move westward in the church, the sculptural world of images does not disappear, but it takes on a different character. We have already seen how at the northern crypt descent the unambiguous animal forms can be transformed into zoomorphic composite figures of a purely fantastic kind. The mobility of these figures as well as those that appear on the aisle capitals is not calm and dignified but dramatic and tension-filled. This tendency is intensified in the outer frames of the two aisle portals. The arch tendrils do not possess the same calm rhythm as in the interior; tendrils, leaves, and animals move in waves or jerky movements that make the entire upper portal frame seethe. The animals do not walk calmly among the grape clusters but twist, rush toward each other, or bite fast onto the tendrils. In this violence it cannot be a matter of the same meaning as in the broad arch band in the interior of the church. The completion that is there intended is admittedly suggested in the portal archivolts, but it still beckons, and what we experience is precisely the efforts to reach the world that nevertheless must exist as the basis for the image. The real and malevolent powers that try to hinder humans on this their way have also taken graspable form in the corbel capitals' demon figures. Here the devil and his retinue reveal themselves in sculpturally palpable form and in shifting forms; the frog-like lions glare malevolently at the one who is to go in through the gate, or the mane rises around the raging head; the angels that come riding on monsters are not God's angels but the devil's. In the capitals that bear the aedicula surrounding the portal opening, the human being themselves is involved in combat with the monsters.

This infernal world, which stands between the human being and their realization of themselves in the sphere suggested in the archivolts, is radically counteracted and finally defeated by the forces that act in the tympanum fields' depictions. These concrete and more unambiguous images also constitute the main motifs in the portals' pictorial decoration. Symbolically they both depict Christ, though in different forms and in different phases of the redemptive work through which he leads humans unharmed through the gate to eternal life. In the north portal one sees admittedly Samson who saves the lamb from the lion's jaws, but Samson as well as the event are merely an image for Christ and his redemptive work, already foreshadowed in the Old Testament. In the south portal the New Testament speaks, and the redemptive work is already completed. For those who were to be saved from the lion's jaws, Christ has let himself be sacrificed, and as God's lamb, Agnus Dei, he occupies with the raised cross-staff as a sign of victory the central place in the tympanum field. The surrounding evangelist symbols stand as proclaimers of what has happened but also as testimony to the event's validity beyond time and space.

Without supposing an intention or even a consciousness on the part of the sculptors who executed the reliefs, we can in these two tympanum images as in previously mentioned reliefs experience a correspondence between the sculptural form and its content. The force and movement that the Samson image expressively wants to convey is not of a physical nature. With undisturbed nonchalance he pries open without effort the lion's jaws, and the fluttering hair braids contrast with the lion's resting position. Samson's casually upright figure instead gives expression to the spiritual force toward which the lamb seeks, and the lion's animal-headed tail attacks in vain. In the south portal's tympanum, Agnus Dei and the evangelist symbols are in themselves at rest, but by being inscribed in the roundels formed by the all-embracing vine tendril, they are partakers of and co-actors in the life-giving spiritual force and movement that ultimately derives its origin from the central image's significance. Despite its character as a symbolic Christ depiction, the concrete image of Samson is a historical narrative in the biblical sense, drawn from a given time and space. The palpably plastic form of the figures emphasizes, as we have seen in other contexts, this pictorial and significance-related isolation. An opposite tendency makes itself felt in the other tympanum field, where the surface-bound relief as a pierced net pattern exists through the background and in correspondence with it shapes a mystery image, sprung from reality, a making-present of the supernatural without dependence on time or space.

The reliefs' different degrees of layering, which so effectively contributes to Romanesque sculpture's significance-shaping, receives in Lund Cathedral a purely architectural expression in the apse's exterior articulation. The high plinth that encloses the crypt located within belongs to the solid wall body. But on top of this and from the plinth rise in ascending rhythm three arcade storeys, which constantly stand in a definite relation to the wall behind, while at the same time they lend the architecture a successive elevation and liberation from matter. The lower storey arcade consists of pilasters and half-columns as bearers of double arches. Both elements are firmly enclosed to the wall behind and give despite their liberation from the massive plinth an impression of load. From this weight the following arcade storey has been liberated by the wall-bound pilasters being replaced by free columns between whose capitals arches only one springily upward-striving arch. The partial liberation from the wall body that has occurred in this storey becomes complete in the uppermost arcade gallery with its closely placed colonnettes in a free space before the inner wall.

In this elevation and liberation of a purely architectural kind but with a sculptural effect, the sculptures incorporated in the arcades' capitals and corbels also participate. The corbel's function is to support and bear, it is also what the two goats do, which reared against each other and with their backward-thrown heads with their horns seem to receive the pressure from the issuing double arch. In the second storey's capitals, humans and four-footed animals reared on their hind legs perform the same service as tectonically bearing elements in the capital's corner. The architectural system inherited from antique thought, which has ultimately been the foundation for the whole strict construction, has also sculpturally left traces in such details as the acanthus leaves on the capitals' lower part and the cymatium and dentil ornamentation of the capitals' cover plates; but this heritage and these formal conditions have only been a means for a genuine new creation in the Romanesque spirit.

Has then this exquisite execution of architectural-sculptural articulation of a building part been of purely aesthetic significance? This we find difficult to imagine. The apse encloses the place for the original high altar and thus manifests outwardly this central point around which the church is built and from which it is motivated. The altar is not merely a communion table, it was also Christ's tomb and above all the place for the resurrection's re-experiencing through the mass's sacramental meaning. One of the relics deposited in the crypt's high altar in 1123 was believed to originate from Christ's tomb; it is around this that the massive plinth closes to at the level of the upper church's floor plan and the actual high altar located on it pass into the arcades that lift themselves in an ever higher and freer elevation as a direct accompaniment to the resurrection's mystery and the spirit's liberation from matter.

In a symbolic sense the apse is also an imitation of the rotunda around Christ's tomb in Jerusalem, the Anastasis, the place for the original resurrection, whose memorial building as a bearer of significance has conveyed the spiritual reality for which it was built. The imitation in Lund is thus not a copy in our sense, but through tradition it can be the idea-content that was imitated; the artistic form, on the other hand, is genuine and created according to the time's and place's special conditions. In the latter respect it is no less remarkable that this apse, created on the outskirts of the then Christian Europe, stands among its peers in more southerly lands as one of the most beautiful creations with regard to both formal quality and significance-related expressive power.

When the monumental stone sculpture made its entry into Lund Cathedral, there was no counterpart in the Scanian countryside to this continentally inspired Romanesque pictorial art. What there was were the raised stones with their Viking Age world of images, simply carved portal frames on some of the many wooden churches, and possibly some isolated stone relief on the very earliest stone churches. These latter reliefs were probably in their stylistic form still strongly inspired by the older tradition's stylistic patterns. The situation changed radically with the creation of the archiepiscopal church. A world of images and forms previously unknown in monumental form made its entry into the Nordic environment. Here it did not, however, develop along the lines it would have followed in its environment of origin but became in its new place instead an enriching incitement to sculptural activity, which spread across the province and also beyond its borders. In this process, impulses streaming in from other quarters cooperated with indigenous tradition. Even within the framework of the cathedral one can in certain places discern how the latter in the form of, for example, complicated animal interlaces with typically Nordic animal-head terminals has enriched the borrowed forms toward new sculptural life.

The Lund sculpture's influence on the countryside has, with a couple of exceptions, not been direct. As a model it has been for the creation of, for example, freestanding lion figures, but there is no question of any slavish copies. The Lund lion possesses something of a "naturalistic" springiness and unconcern regarding its bearing function. From Tryde church a lion is preserved that has had the same function. It has, however, grown together with the base of the column it has carried into a powerful block of in itself sculptural effect.

Even though the main part of the countryside's Romanesque stone sculpture in its diversity and variation has had no or little direct contact with the Lund formal world, this is not to say that the cathedral would not have had significance for its creation. The sculpture in the Scanian rural churches would certainly not have displayed such a multifaceted richness if the cathedral had not existed as an impulse-giving factor, and it is as such that it has played the greatest role for Scanian pictorial art in general.

At the cathedral construction, sculptors have worked not only brought-in foreigners but in due course with great probability also indigenous labour. In this way the building lodge became a true melting pot for the rich sculptural development that 12th-century Skåne displayed. We could imagine that such a Scanian stone master was responsible for the execution of, for example, the begun but never completed relief that one finds at the entrance to the north transept chapel. It may serve as a concluding vignette to this discursive text. In the continuation of the figures that one senses outside the image surface lies a suggestion of all the sculptures that exist but that could not fit within the book's frame. The only contour-drawn sketch in the lower right corner gives a picture of the character in this text. And in the two connected animals that the Romanesque stone master never had the opportunity to complete, we see a reference to the progressing creation that was not only the stone master's task but is also ours, as we with activated consciousness anew and with shifting aspects experience the world of images that has been left to us from the century that for Skåne's part has been its in a spiritual sense richest and most vital.

[Translator's Note: This is a stanza from the traditional Scandinavian ballad *Bendik og Årolilja* (Bendik and Årolilja), a tragic medieval love story akin to Romeo and Juliet. The ballad tells of the forbidden love between the knight Bendik and the king's daughter Årolilja, which ends in their deaths. The refrain "Årolilja! Why do you sleep so long?" recurs throughout the ballad, taking on increasingly poignant meaning as the tragedy unfolds. The text here is in an older Norwegian dialect form (Nynorsk/Landsmål tradition).]

## MARGINAL NOTES BY ASGER JORN

*Good art is always national.*  
*National art is always bad.*

Harald Giersing

<br>

Just as the frameworks of the old civilizations are today being broken down to make room for a world culture, the same is happening within art. From the one-sided preoccupation with European art and the European *view of art*, what is called modern art development has opened up a universal view of art that aims toward a world art, and to such a degree that one could wish to extend Giersing's line of thought and state that good art is always universal, but universal art is always bad. By the latter is meant the cosmopolitanism that consciously installs itself as being universal.

If Nordic art were entirely European in its essence, this series of art books would long ago have been published. But now the situation is that it possesses a dual nature that is both European and not European. The difficulty lies in clarifying its relationship on the one hand to the European and on the other hand to the universal in its essence. If one chose the European view of art as a standard of value, this art would merely appear as a subordinate peripheral variant of an art development whose center begins in the Mediterranean region. This has been attempted without success. But if one chose the opposite and claimed an entirely isolated and absolutely independent Nordic art development, this would again at best be reduced to a poor presentation, and at worst be a thorough deception. We must remain in the tension between the universal, the Nordic, and the European throughout our description, and it is this difficult art that I hope to successfully practice throughout this work, based on the hope of thereby making a new contribution to world art.

If one seeks to arrive at a final decisive distinction of the object of one's investigation, it is first necessary to possess a series of instruments capable of working with the sharpest precision. Words are the instruments with which one describes. To be precise, words must cover a univocal meaning, what is called a concept. For the sake of a good result, we are thus forced to clarify certain concepts fundamental to our work, where these are taken in their most pointed meaning.

The view of art that we have inherited from the Latin-European cultural sphere, and which until a hundred years ago was the sole ruler, is, like its view of political, social, and cultural phenomena, constructed with literary *historicism* as its starting point. Classical historiography in the strictest sense, and this also applies to art history, bases its investigations on contemporary records of historical events, in relation to which the material is explained. Hereby the material is not only tied to specific events but is also explained from the places and times, from the perspectives from which contemporary historiography has taken place. Until Saxo Grammaticus wrote his Danish history, typically in Latin, it is only the Greeks and Romans who have written history, including about Scandinavia.

If one uses this material as the basis for a Nordic art history, it appears as a provincial and insignificant variant of south-east European and Oriental art currents without active influence on the general art development in Europe. But the very concept of provincialism has no meaning at all unless one agrees that the essential thing in art at any given time takes place in specific centers of radiation. That such centers of radiation actually exist and can form the basis for a coherent explanation of art developments does not prevent other modes of description from being possible and fruitful.

No one could think of calling the art of the South Sea Islands provincial. If this word is to have a precise meaning, it must cover a peripheral activity as part of a centralized economic, technical, and social entity, of a state formation such as the Roman one. The contrast here is clear between the provincial-Roman art and the Nordic art during the Migration Period.

In the last century, as a countermeasure against the theory of provincialism in the European unity, nationalism was revived as an artistic standard of value as well. With the nation-state, however, one merely limited the contrast between capital and province to a contrast within national frameworks. It is typical of the North that the most universally minded artists and writers in this period increasingly stood in opposition to the capitals. It is in this spiritual homeland movement, which rejects the contrast between the national and the European, that this work has its richly worked-through foundation.

Classical historiography must give up where there are no literary sources in relation to which it can develop its subject. Since almost the entire area we are dealing with here is, in the strictest sense, ahistorical, it is necessary to treat it according to completely different principles, methods, and structures. Over the past hundred years, these have been gathered in the science called archaeology. Literary historiography explains the relics of the past from written sources. Archaeology writes its history directly from conclusions about the inner coherence of the relics themselves, and thus follows the reverse interplay. Historiography is something between art and science. Archaeology cannot afford to be that. On the other hand, archaeology remains hypothetical in its combinations of phenomena, where literary history allows itself to assert and establish facts, admittedly as an expression of the interests behind the wish to preserve the account of a specific event seen with specific eyes. If archaeological researchers agree on the authenticity of a find, if this then contradicts written accounts, the latter are considered untrue or distorted, since the object does not possess the same ability to lie as the word.

Events and occurrences are the nodal points of literary history. But these can never have any clear archaeological meaning. Archaeological research can specify time, place, and type, but is in itself an eventless shadowland. The accidental connection to literary historiography places Nordic art in a peculiar half-light, where fragments emerge here and there, and otherwise leaves the observer to fantasize about the rest. These are the conditions under which these books must necessarily be assembled.

There is unfortunately just this unfortunate circumstance, that the artistic experience, which must be the purpose of publishing art books, can only have a very limited interest for archaeology's main subject, indeed, by virtue of the fact that the artistic experience lies precisely in the encounter with the unique and the exceptional, it can directly be distracted by archaeology's main subject in its relation to the normal and typical. This means that the archaeologists who write these art books are forced to place themselves outside their central subject area in order to give us precisely the information we need here for purely artistic reasons.

Where the archaeologist compiles his material, it is in order to gain and clarify the understanding of a deeper historical connection. This naturally cannot be the purpose of art books, which must seek to emphasize the individual object's special artistic value and essence in itself.

When I with a certain peace of mind dare to make this extraordinary demand of Nordic archaeologists, it is in pride over the knowledge that there already exists such a comprehensive archaeological literature worked through by the Nordic researchers in our area, that it is everywhere possible for them also to satisfy the desire for a knowledge that is not directly bound to the immediate archaeological methodology.

Instead of inventing an imaginary art history of literary tinge, we have thus attempted to present a divided collaboration between a purely artistic approach to the material through poetry, image selection, and layout, and a purely scientifically based text to achieve the Synthesis through this collaboration.

The tradition-bound repetitions that are usually called culture become unbearable emptiness and monotonous routine if they are not counteracted by art's changeable richness. This inner tension between art and culture forms the latent tension in the material we have before us here. This tension was dissolved in the Greco-Roman cultural sphere, which formed the foundation for the modern industrial cities' civilization by dissolving the connection between practical production's standardized stereotypy and the thereby isolated artwork. From this effort, the corresponding classical aesthetics was developed, which sees and describes the artwork in "splendid isolation" as an independent formal whole. This aesthetics too is inapplicable as a standard for Nordic art, where art is absorbed in a social, practical, and human functionality, as a kind of spiritual accompaniment to life. The task of isolating the individual artwork from the typological, the traditional, and the functional can therefore never become absolute here, if the picture is to be truthful.

The breakthrough of industrialism at the beginning of the last century was aided by the classical aesthetics, which increasingly has isolated the world of art from practical and technical development. But it seems to me that this development today has reached such a high degree of perfection that one is beginning to be able to appreciate art forms with a more intimate connection to life, without thereby needing to risk an attack on art's independence. A problem formulation that sets up one or the other of these art forms as the highest or the lowest seems quite inapplicable today. It answers questions that are as absurd as the problem of whether an hour is worth more than a meter. Instead of the traditional value hierarchy, which in this area arises from a rather superficial simplification that benefits neither art nor the artistic experience, it would be enriching if one measured art by the standards with which it has measured itself.

When it is the archaeological method that is followed in this series of books, it is thus not because of a special sympathy for traditionalism in art, but from a purely objective recognition that it is the only scientific foundation that can be laid for an exploration of this more or less ahistorical art. When Nordic artistic development is so suited to an explanation through archaeological typology that it is Nordic research that has built up the first basic elements of this science, it is first and foremost because Scandinavia has never had a provincial position in relation to foreign great powers, and has also never since the Stone Age been subjected to immigrating peoples who could create new and more complex social changes.

This is again because it is a new and inhospitable land that only emerged from the inland ice ten thousand years ago, and therefore must be regarded as the youngest land with the oldest people in Europe. As much ravage as the Scandinavians are reported to have caused in other countries' historical course, just as static and eventless in relation to the great upheavals elsewhere, life seems to have proceeded in this harsh climate, from which a stream of people spread to such a degree that Tacitus referred to it as a human womb. It is this barbaric view of the Northerners that we through this work will seek to change.

Precisely the close connection between art and culture has in the North produced what one can call a high artistic culture, a great appreciation of art, which can be seen from the many art objects of smaller format that have been brought home from abroad by traveling people in prehistoric times, and among which even a Chinese Buddha figure has found its place. In the same way, one must explain the overwhelming quantities of domestic artistic monuments that have been preserved and protected in Scandinavia, and of which those reproduced in this series are only a part. Just as easily as one can underestimate the artistic culture, it is however on the other hand just as easy to overestimate it, as one is particularly inclined to do in Scandinavia and in the United States, for the artistic culture does not concern the creative artist at all, nor the artistic creative process. It is exclusively a cultivation of fastidiousness in artistic enjoyment, of demands on art, but is barren, yes can be directly hostile to any artistic renewal. The artistic culture in the North therefore has difficulty finding its expression in the artistic creative process itself in the North. The folk tale about the artist troll Finn has its origin in Old Norse mythology and expresses a typical situation in Nordic artistic development. Whether this is a real deficiency or an advantage shall be left unsaid. The great contribution that the Northern European researchers and collectors have made in bringing forth the art of the Mediterranean countries is in any case an enormously positive result of this love of art.

Whether the art-theoretical historicism is formalistic as in Lionello Venturi's principles or symbolistic as in Erwin Panofsky's iconology, it unfortunately always ends in an attack on contemporary art, because it fails to correspond to the value norms that historicism finds in the past and which by many are perceived as eternally valid. Some call them objective.

It seems to me to be a logical conclusion that an understanding of art that is forced systematically to deny its contemporary art a value in order to assert itself, thereby necessarily reveals a misjudgment or limitation that must also affect the material that through the theory is valued highest.

A progressive development of the Nordic view of art, as it will reveal itself as this series of books appears, will, if my hope is not put to shame, be able to fill the gap in the artistic description that these two excellent theorists have been forced to leave empty in order each to form their discipline within the framework of a coherent logic. As a starting point for such a third art attitude complementary to these, I intend to use the Danish art historian Julius Lange's observations. I hope through this contribution to art theory to arrive at a theoretical confirmation also of free artistic expression today and into the future, and to arrive at a concretization of the efforts through which Whistler in his time fertilized modern artistic development.

There was a break in artistic development when we reached the phenomenon usually referred to as modern art, which first fully broke through with Whistler and the Impressionists. From the conviction that art has its purpose in itself, and in nothing other than itself, art was thereby freed as an independent activity from its serving social, political, historical, scientific, and technical function.

In this development, the whole emphasis has hitherto been placed on the liberation of the artwork as an independent object or on the artist as an independent personality. But it seems to me that both these liberations merely lead to the isolation and increasing opposition of art and the artist, where an empty play with formal technique or the individual's tragic fate becomes art's only content, if a third aspect of this liberation is not emphasized. But this requires that one understands the distinction between what is called the purpose and what is the end goal. If art is its own end goal, then it can never have a purpose to strive for, not even itself. But if art has no purpose in itself, this does not prevent many non-artistic activities from seeking their purpose in art.

If one says that art not only has its end goal in itself, but ultimately is the end goal of all human activity but not its purpose, then one merely expresses the demonstrable fact expressed in the words Ars longa, vita brevis. If art becomes life's purpose, the meaning of life itself is reduced to the preparation of an immortal monument. If, on the other hand, one in accordance with Johannes Holbek understands art as a life form, then art contains in itself a claim to life, then art becomes what is spoken of in "The High One's Speech," the afterfame that never dies. If thus the artwork according to Nordic conception is a life form, then it is at the same time a form that only reveals its truth at the moment it has absorbed the life that created it, which thus prevents the possibility of appreciating an artistic development until the moment it has stopped and been completed. Nowhere in the world does one probably know such a respectful and absolutely neutrally waiting attitude toward the artistic process as in the North. Therefore it receives, whether it concerns a gift sunk in the bog's darkness or brought forth on a mound as in the oldest times or created in modern surroundings, the character of an irrevocable sacrificial act, for which no account can be rendered, of a meaningless surprise, for which we have no other expression than what is called the gift of grace, which in its heavy and clumsy way expresses what in southern lightness can be united in the concept of grace. There shall be three of them. We already know the two. It is the third we have now begun to hunt.

## ERIK CINTHIO

Docent Erik Cinthio was born in 1921. He received his doctorate in 1957 with a dissertation on Lund Cathedral during the Romanesque period and was appointed the same year as docent in art history with medieval archaeology at Lund University. In his dissertation, he partly broke with an older tradition when it comes to investigations of a similar kind: The archaeological remains, the monument and its artworks were allowed to form the starting point for an unprejudiced analysis as a means to an explanation of the building's both practical and ideal function as well as its position in the historical context.

During the past ten years, Cinthio has, among other things, worked on the development of the new methodological guidelines for a historical archaeology. He has thereby gathered around him a group of young scientists who have worked with archaeological problems concerning the Middle Ages, and who have adopted his view of research. From 1 July 1965, Cinthio will hold a preceptorship in medieval archaeology at Lund University, the first professorship in this subject in Scandinavia.

## GERARD FRANCESCHI

Gerard Franceschi, who was born in Bordeaux in 1915, is one of the world's few prominent specialists in the photography of artworks. During the twenty years he was employed in the French museum service, he enriched us with a series of art literature's most beautiful works: L'histoire commence à Sumer - Les Etrusques - L'art Gaulois - Auvergne romane - Poitou romane, and more. But the work on the sculptor Gislebertus, as we know it in Franceschi's reproduction of the work in Autun, surpasses in importance everything else. Franceschi knows and empathizes with the artwork more than the photography itself, which was merely the means he was fortunate to find in his youth to express and capture the essence of art, evoked through a sensitive temperament. Together with the many years of experience that produces circumspection and meaning in what he occupies himself with, we see here the explanation for the intense life that meets us in his reproductions. Franceschi has moved to Scandinavia to take on the artistic direction of this book work in the photographic work.
