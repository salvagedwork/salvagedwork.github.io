## INTRODUCTION

*During a visit I made to the church of Damville, in Normandy, in 1946, and during my stay with the painter Pierre Wemaëre, at Pinson, my attention was drawn to the scratchings and graffiti with which the porch of this church was abundantly covered.*

*Noticing similar scratchings later in Denmark, Sweden and Norway, on the cathedrals of Ribe, Lund and Trondhjem, I decided to study this phenomenon more closely.*

*The necessary means for this undertaking were given to me in the spring of '61. I then set off on the Norman adventure accompanied by the photographer Gérard Franceschi.*

*We found in the departments of l'Eure and Calvados a significant number of graffiti. In other areas, nothing was found. Wherever the churches had been restored, traces of graffiti had disappeared. Sometimes, as in example no. 178, a portion is revealed when a piece of superimposed stucco has fallen away.*

*Many inscriptions, in both Latin and French, are of great historical interest; we have however disregarded them.*

*We found no images of copulation, nor of hearts pierced by an arrow. The reproductions faithfully present all the subjects found. There is thus no possibility of a selection of subjects adapted to a preconceived interpretation. The only graffito that was retraced was the footprint no. 73.*

*At the beginning, the research was conducted somewhat by chance, which explains the lack of indication of origin for some of them. But all the churches visited are in the register, and greater precision would require a second survey for which I do not have the necessary time.*

*At no point had I supposed that we could truly make a very rich harvest of images. Nor that the signs would be admirably preserved. Yet this was the case.*

*The works and studies on similar themes having seemed to me to be of great poverty, I was tempted to bring together the magnificent photos by Franceschi and the texts of some of the best specialists in this field.*

*I hasten to say that these latter, who showed in my project an interest for which I thank them warmly, have overwhelmed, by the kindness and warmth of their welcome, the amateur that I am.*

## SIGNS OF THE FERTILITY CULT

P. V. GLOB,  
*Archaeologist*

An entire universe of images of a particular character has quietly traversed time, on the walls of the churches of Normandy. And yet it was subject to perpetual development and enrichment. It has been evoked by an artist with an alert eye, who now communicates it to us. These strange signs and images, executed and known by the local population only, are thus in these pages exposed to the attention of a wider public, in other countries.

An abundance of signs and symbols spreads across these stone surfaces, and precisely because these drawings are not due to a single hand from a particular era, but represent the activity of a multitude, from remote periods up to our own days, each surface merges into a very living unity, in which nature also participates through its play of colours with the grey-brown-yellow of the lichen flowers.

It is impossible to date the earliest images. Even by dating, with relative precision, the numerous churches, castles and farms where the carved stones can be found, it remains the case that for some of them, the place they currently occupy may constitute only their second use, their origin being in places of worship several millennia old. Such practices are well known. This concerns primarily the stones bearing cup-shaped hollows, as they are arranged on the first pages: freely scattered, or in straight lines, circles, rectangles and other geometric forms which may represent men as well as animals. This symbol is known throughout the entire world, in its most remote antiquity. It can be traced back five thousand years in the past, in this same material and this same character that we find here. These holes carved in the rock are still today the object of cultural practices at the foot of the Himalayas, where women bring their offerings of yellow flower cups to ensure, by means of this symbol of the female sex, fertility and happiness.

The cup-shaped hollows seem to follow the ancient route of cultural communication that continues from the Middle East, through the Mediterranean and along the coasts of Western Europe, to the Nordic countries attached to a particular fertility cult. This cult had succeeded in subjecting this immense domain, from the third millennium before our era, and until the end of the first millennium of it.

In western France, this sign is attached, among other things, to the magnificent stone tombs of the Gulf of Morbihan in Brittany, which are from the second millennium. It is also found on the stones of the menhirs forming immense processional paths, such as for example the alignments of Kermario. Several of the stones reproduced here could be taken from similar places; just as in Denmark one often finds old stones — with the cup-shaped hollows — reused in the construction of thresholds, or as bases (see number 6).

We do not know until what era this sign retained its magical power, but it is also found, reproduced in great numbers, on the stones of the steps of the famous temple of Athena, on the Acropolis of Athens, traced long after the temple was completed. In our day, it is seen serving for games, all around the Persian Gulf, and also in other places. This does not prevent it from having contained for the people of these regions other, more ancient meanings; but rather implies a problem of the ritual role that ancient games may have played, in matters of divination.

The cup-shaped hollows are, throughout the Mediterranean, Western European and Northern European zones, linked to the ancient cult of the Earth Mother. A long series of signs: circles around holes, a wheel with a cross, hollows and circles extended with radiations, etc. (numbers 16 to 30), are however centred on the forces of the sky, a cult that penetrated with horse-riding peoples who invaded the North and Central Europe, approximately 4,000 years ago. From this period on, and in the few millennia that follow, these two religions, that of the sky and that of the earth, meet and refract in the art of images, and give it its content. We find this art on the megalithic monuments, both in the Gulf of Morbihan and in eastern Ireland, where we can encounter all the hollows, circles and other signs that are in this book. Even though the circular sign, in its numerous variants, appears linked to solar power, it is nonetheless likely that it should be considered, in certain cases, as the eye that watches over the mother-goddess.

The same connection with a fertility cult that has maintained itself to this day is also reflected in many other images in this book. This is the case with numerous footprints, single or double, which are often combined, in the west and north of Europe, with the cup-shaped hollows. This sign, together with that of the sun, can be traced through the entire Iron Age, into the Christian period (numbers 68 and 74). The numerous sacred footprints on the rocks and stones of India are attributed to Buddha or Vishnu, but in many places there exist old traditions that attribute to the imprint of the human foot a beneficent, fertilising, productive power. The same is the case with the shoe, known as such in Greek culture, among others. This tradition survives into our era, in the custom of tying a shoe to the newlyweds' car. One thus sees shoe prints with an indication of the heel (number 73) and the shoe itself (number 75). The type of this shoe belongs to the 16th–17th centuries, which indicates the date of its execution. In general, the foot as a symbol of power as well as the hand (numbers 78 to 82), protects against maleficent forces and acquires, through magical rites, a divine power that spreads to the place where it has been drawn.

The horse, that marvellous animal, belongs to the powers of the sky. It arrives from the steppes of Asia at the end of the third millennium BC, as a draught animal, as a mount, and as a dairy animal. Its image is powerful, and provokes fertility (numbers 107 to 112). It pulls the sun behind it across the sky, it is linked to fire. Thus was attached to the god of fertility, in Nordic paganism, a trait that manifests itself down to us with the horse-shaped corvette, in the environs of Lille. Likewise the image of the stag (numbers 95 to 102) and that of the bird (numbers 61 to 66) belong to this same category.

There is a series of boats under full sail, some of which could have been made by our grandparents (numbers 40 to 48), and others more ancient. All recall the nave of the church and the carnival boat. The boat itself belonged, three thousand years ago, to the god of fertility in the Middle East, in Greece (the boat of Dionysus), and in the North where fertility rites were inseparable from popular processions with boats. This transport of boats is still known today, notably in carnival processions, even if its original purpose has been forgotten. In Normandy, it seems however that memories of antiquity have been kept deep in people's minds.

Several subjects confirm the coexistence of these images with official Christian culture. The superb cathedrals and the modest places of prayer (numbers 158, 62), the church bells (number 176), the tombstone (number 137), the keys of Saint Peter (number 83) and the ladder to heaven (number 116). The key was, in the Viking era, a thousand years ago, the sign worn around the neck, in silver or bronze, as a token of attachment to the Christian faith; while others wore the sign of the hammer to manifest their faithfulness to the ancient powers of the sky (it is difficult to know whether to interpret numbers 194–196 in this way). Even if Christianity apparently reigned on the surface of the land, it turns out that far more ancient beliefs dominate the world of images surveyed here. This is not a unique case, and all those who visit the charming Frascati, at Monti Albani, south of Rome, can still today bite with an affectionate tooth the figurines of three-breasted women sold in the small bakers' shops, present testimony of the ancient goddess of fertility: Astarte, Aphrodite or Ava, or whatever other name was given to the Magna Mater, the mother of origins.


## NORTH AND NORMANDY

Gutorm GJESSING,  
*Professor of Ethnology at the University of Oslo.*

The images in this book are chosen from thousands of signs engraved or drawn on the walls of churches, in Normandy. Among them are representations of churches and bell towers, but above all an abundance of crosses, generally placed on bases of different shapes. One even encounters the rooster that represents valour (numbers 64 and 67) or hearts, sometimes intertwined hearts. The fleur-de-lys is found in a few places, or else more lugubrious motifs, such as the gallows from which the wrongdoer hangs. In addition to this, a great number of subjects, apparently without particular interest, belong to everyday life: horses, often with a rider, stags, birds, snakes, footprints, hands, and an incredible quantity of small round cup-shaped holes. These subjects are not, by far, as insignificant as they appear. They are even more interesting than the rest.

Some of these figures are dated. A stag is dated 1753. A little higher, on the same wall, one finds the number 1780 — and something, the last digit being effaced (number 99). In another place, there is the number 164; perhaps 1640. One finds still other dates: 1602 (?), 1620, 1740, 180 (?), without these dates corresponding directly to the drawings. A fairly precise indication is found in the different styles, and especially in the different types of boats. This proves to us that the origins of these drawings are very diverse, from the Middle Ages up to the end of the last century. The boat in number 59 seems to have been engraved around 1110, while three-masters, frigate-rigged vessels, schooners, brigs carrying all their canvas, sometimes sloops and even a coaster with a gaff rig can hardly be earlier than the period around 1800. A paddle-wheel boat (the advent of steam) confirms this. And the animal that turns its head to bite its own tail belongs, on the other hand, to the classical subjects of Romanesque art (number 114).

The superposition of several layers of figuration also shows, through the chronological survey of the execution of the images that thus becomes possible, that long periods have passed over this enterprise. Even with photographs of a remarkable quality, as they are presented here, it would be futile to attempt the analysis of the different chronological layers from the photographic reproduction of the whole. It is moreover very unlikely that establishing such a survey could teach us something whose importance could be weighed against the immense sum of work, and the long duration, that would be involved in research on the monuments themselves.

What we are dealing with here is not a professional art, of whatever kind. It is the simple man, more or less pious, who spends his time there while waiting for mass to begin; or more likely, after having brought his offerings to the Saviour, the Holy Virgin and the other saints. The images are hardly produced as works of art, in the sense we currently give to this term, except in a few rare attempts where one senses a conscious aesthetic desire. This manifests itself most clearly in the rosette (number 173) where the tension between the square and the curves of the eight-petalled rose, combined with the decisive technique, shows that we are dealing with a "popular" artist with skill and vigour. Other figurations show the feeling for form and the sureness of hand, and achieve striking results. This is the case with several boats, such as the sloop number 46, the coaster (yacht?) number 48, or the brig number 58. Often the circles were executed with compasses of various kinds. This is especially visible with those in which six-petalled rosettes are inscribed.

One can however observe, as a dominant rule, that the essential preoccupation is the image, the symbol, or rather the metaphor itself. It is thus that this participates in what is called *popular art, in its most authentic form.* The most ordinary people felt the need to express themselves in images, to translate in them things that were elementary and central in the life of their interests and feelings; and along with this, to bring to light associative images, which arose through an apparent chance from the closed depths of their unconscious, and it is precisely this last part that is of such great interest.

Because the unconscious does not create associations in a void. They are realised on the basis of supposedly "forgotten" experiences, and what constitutes traditions are precisely such effaced experiences. To be truly capable of assessing the significance of these images, we are obliged to make a preliminary clarification of what constitutes *tradition* in its ultimate foundation; and then to specify some data from the ancient history of Normandy, in order to be able to situate the traditions presented here.

Tradition encompasses everything that passes from generation to generation as beliefs, habits, ideas and images. It is not subjective in the sense of individual, of belonging to particular men. It is on the contrary an all-encompassing accumulation of the experiences lived in the whole of society, thus representing a subjectivity common to all. This characterises not only the small local society, but also larger ethnic units, the people or the nation. It even plays a role in what can be called the great cohesion of social culture: what is ordinarily called "our Western civilisation", and what is characterised by the American Robert Redfield by the name of "the great tradition".

Tradition accumulates elements from everywhere, and covers innumerable generations. But tradition is far from being static; it is ceaselessly engaged in a process of transformation. New experiences are constantly added, while others disappear.

Conscious intelligence is always individual and analytical, because attention to things is necessarily self-centred. Consciousness is like a lighthouse, which can send its beam of light everywhere, and thus cover the entire horizon, but only in small sectors, successively. Tradition is on the contrary synthetic, encompasses everything, and thereby takes on an apparently objective character, because all the contributions of "forgotten" experience are melted into *a great plastic unity,* whose coherence is perfect in time as well as in space.

The entire process of traditionalisation that has been going on since the beginning continues today, and goes on into the future. What is forgotten does not disappear. It merely sinks down to the levels of the subconscious and the unconscious; and yesterday's events are already en route towards the traditional mass. This process has continued through a million years or even more, since tradition also seems to be a partially constitutive factor of animal behaviour.

True tradition is unconscious, because we live within it and are ceaselessly shaped by it. Once made conscious, it changes its aspect entirely, it transforms into *traditionalism,* a phenomenon that plays a considerable, and very largely dangerous, role in the dynamic modern world, which gives so little free play to true traditions, nor thereby to the imagination. Combined with the expansive dynamism of our era, modern traditionalism develops a desire for national power that is foreign to authentic traditions.

What is most difficult to define are the traditional elements that originate from cohesions of great amplitude, or that have become linked to such a cohesion, because in their case all the detailed elements of this great ensemble are to such a degree in interaction that they change character in the process; as a result, they become very difficult to locate in the interplay of the whole. Local traditions, on the contrary, are often fairly easy to demonstrate. As examples of such purely local traditions, we shall mention a few cases whose incredible antiquity has been established by archaeologists. These examples are limited to the Scandinavian domain alone, but similar ones could certainly be found in many other countries.

The archaeologist Karl Rygh reported, in his day, the following: "In 1876 I had been told, in the district of Strinda in the environs of Trondheim, that there was a legend according to which a knight in armour and his horse lay beneath a great boulder. He was supposedly surprised by a rockfall as he was passing through the valley, and crushed. I took the trouble to dig under the boulder as far as I was able, and I did indeed find the bones of a horse and a man, and in addition a fire-steel and two lance-points manifestly dating from the Viking era. The presence of a tomb was ruled out." It must be admitted that the poor horseman, after his hasty burial, had been equipped with an equally imaginary harness and dignity of a knight. The accuracy of the tradition is no less striking, when one considers that it was communicated across a period of a thousand years, and fixed to a precise block of rock, among so many others.

Even longer is the duration of the tradition concerning a great mound, "Ottarshögen", in the commune of Vendel at Uppsala in Sweden. The mound measures forty metres in diameter, and was mentioned as "Uttershögen" in 1670. In the years 1914–16, the mound was excavated by a specialist, Professor Sune Lindquist, one of the most remarkable Swedish archaeologists. In the middle of the mound, he discovered a tomb in which had been deposited a wooden cup with gilded bronze fittings, calcified bones, game pieces and the fragments of a bone comb. The find is fairly well placed in the chronology by a gold coin from the currency of the Eastern Roman Empire struck under Emperor Basiliscus (476–77). The coin having been used as a pendant, and being rather worn, this leads us to propose for the construction of the tomb a date placed in the first decades of the 6th century. This period corresponds precisely to the time when the king of the Ynglinge family, Ottar Vendelkraka, died, following the genealogical line given by the "Ynglingatal". Professor Lindqvist thus has good reason to advance that the mound of Utter at Vendel was the tomb of Ottar Vendelkraka. In a paler form, we see here tradition maintaining itself alive for 1,400 years.

In the north of Oslo is situated the largest tumulus in Northern Europe; Raknehaugen at Ullensaker. It measures ninety-five metres in diameter and fifteen metres in height. The tradition according to which a king was buried there is however not clearly proven by the excavations. The Norwegian archaeologist Anders Lorange had learned, during his student years, that a king had been buried there between his two horses, and then covered with several layers of carpentry. With youthful enthusiasm, he set about digging, descending into a shaft supported by timber frames, and he had reached a depth of sixteen feet when his entire construction collapsed. This happened, fortunately for him, at dinnertime. After this perilous adventure, he began an attack from the side and was very happy when, on the east side, he found the skeleton of a horse sixty feet from the edge. Nothing prevents, however, the hypothesis then put forward being correct, according to which this skeleton came from a horse that had dropped dead: since one does not eat dead horses, they could have disposed of it by burying it in the mound. Be that as it may, Doctor Sigurd Grieg, who systematically excavated the mound during the years 1939–40, found no tomb. There was however one remarkable fact. Three layers of carpentry were superimposed within, and calculations would allow one to envisage that they must have been composed of approximately thirty thousand pieces of wood. Radiological analysis suggests that the mound must have been made around the same period as that of Ottar, or perhaps some time after. But the tradition of the carpentry was in any case confirmed by reality.

In Denmark, one finds traditions that are even more ancient, and apparently truthful. In the old days, the people of the canton of Bolling recounted that a chariot full of gold was buried in the marsh of the presbytery of Dejbjerg. This seemed incredible. But when people began to dig in the marsh in 1881 and 1883 they found not one chariot, but two. Although they were not laden with gold, their value is inestimable. They are cult chariots from the pre-Roman era. Ceremonial chariots made of oak and ash, adorned with bronze in the Celtic style. The vehicles had been deliberately destroyed and deposited in the marsh as an offering. In this case we are dealing with a tradition two thousand years old.

One final Norwegian memory, which is worth mentioning because it reveals a purely local tradition that takes us back in time to five or six thousand years ago. At Bømlo, south of Bergen, there is a small islet: Hespriholmen. There one finds a curious large quarry dating from the period between the Mesolithic and the Neolithic, from which stones of a very fine quality, dense and green in colour, were extracted. Axes from this quarry are found spread throughout large areas of western Norway. The axes being, in popular traditions, called "thunderbolts", it seems that the name of the islet should be linked to the Viking period, and deciphered as "the place where one seeks the thunderbolts".

We thus observe that the traditional element can maintain itself alive, attached to a precise place, for thousands of years. No one should be surprised by the fact that these elements are embellished by the imagination, because it is precisely in the great formless mass of traditions that the imagination seeks its raw materials, and the data it gathers there can be combined in the most diverse ways. In the examples mentioned here, we are dealing solely with traditions based on localised social units, without support in the general traditional cohesion. It is obvious that the latter is much more stable, much more resistant to any attack, precisely because it involves groupings covering wider expanses.

A characteristic and important example of this kind is demonstrated by the powerful position that is bestowed upon the bear in the beliefs and folk medicine of the North. The bear possesses "the strength of ten men and the intelligence of twelve men." Such is its renown. Until the middle of the last century, a bear's paw was used, in folk medicine, to facilitate childbirth; and even in our century it has been possible to obtain written testimonies concerning the affinity between the bear and the pregnant woman, and about its capacities as a midwife.

The archaeological data also show us the dominant position that the bear has occupied in the North, as a supernatural force and fertilising power, from at least the Mesolithic era. Its importance in this domain from the Palaeolithic era on the European continent has been confirmed by the evidence from the cave of Montespan, in Haute-Garonne, where a bear sculpted in clay was found, but without a head, with a bear's skull placed before it between its paws. The clay body also bore numerous marks of arrows and pikes, or similar weapons. Here we can probably trace a tradition back to twenty thousand years ago.

But in such a case, we are also dealing with a traditional coherence of enormous extent. Starting from the Scandinavian peninsula, where the tradition pursued its intense and strong cultural life at least until the last two or three centuries, a cult of the bear in similar forms can be traced across the entire belt of the Russian and Asian forests, across the Bering Strait to North America. There one can note its extension southward to Southern California, New Mexico and Arizona. While the Scandinavian bear had a preference for pregnant women, we learn from the Indians of the Northwest that there exist numerous accounts concerning the tendency of women to let themselves be seduced by a bear, and therefore to give birth to one of their children.

Another current of the great traditional cohesion, in the North, is the subject of the Indo-European influence at the end of the Neolithic: the bear was replaced by the horse as the supreme power of fecundation, for the upper class of the Indo-Europeans. This position was held by the horse until the encounter with Christianity, around the year 1000. The violent effort by which the new church erected a taboo against the habit of eating horse meat was thus well justified, even if it did not achieve a resounding success. One still finds today numerous horseshoes above church entrances, everywhere in the North. This victory of the cult of the horse as the supreme power of fecundity, among the Indo-European masters, by no means prevented the bear from continuing to survive quite comfortably in the non-Indo-Europeanised layers of the population, nor even from imposing itself into the Indo-European tradition. Bear teeth were in common use in northern Norway at least until the 14th century.

It is good to point out, moreover, that this tradition — apart from the Palaeolithic memories of the bear cult at Montespan — does not in any way link the North with the continent on the side of Western Europe or Central Europe; but rather connects it to Eastern Europe and northern Asia. There were numerous Asian influences in the Western European Palaeolithic.

The bear tradition is thus placed in a position that differentiates it from the vital, and more present, traditions that are for modern European-American civilisation the classical traditions and those that manifest the influence of western Asia: the religious and ethical traditions of Christianity, which for their part were largely shaped by Persian traditions. In art and thought, there thus infiltrate, in addition to the Graeco-Roman traditions, those of the Arabs and those of India, a mixture that is still apparent in our day. A rather curious trace can be followed in this line, among other things in the field of coinage terminology. From the Roman gold piece, *solidus aureus,* solidus survives in the Italian *solde* and the French *sou,* while aureus was left to the Scandinavians who keep it in the form of *öre.* The sign of the English *pound* corresponds to the Roman *libra,* and that of the *dollar* is once again that of the *solidus.* Moreover the ancient Scandinavian silver coin *ort* was the Roman *denarius argentus* of the time of the republic. In the Middle Ages, an intermediary variant was formed, the *ertog* or *örtug.*

Even if archaeologists and historians are, for the most part, aware of this strange tenacity of the life of traditions, one has the impression that almost all of them regard it as a curiosity without significance rather than as a fundamental reality for the most important aspects of cultural formation. The moment seems to have come when we must begin to restore to this phenomenon its proper value.

One can legitimately consider *traditional coherence as* a global unity without precise boundaries, with elements of very variable duration and importance. There are elements that seem quickly vanished, barely mentioned. At the very moment of the event itself, it is already on its way towards the unconscious unity. So that tradition identifies itself more or less with what Emile Durkheim called, in his day, *the collective consciousness,* in a profoundly revised sense of course. What Durkheim did not know was the unconscious and subconscious power of tradition. For him, social consciousness was rather a kind of social soul of an individual character. It is what thinks, feels and wills, even though will, feeling and thought act only through individual consciousnesses, he wrote in "Sociologie et Philosophie" (1925). One can at the same time see in the concept of tradition a greatly modified reformulation of the old *Völkergedanke* or popular thought of Adolf Bastian, while his *Elementargedanken,* or elementary thoughts, would be found, in a modern formula, in a rapprochement with the archetypes of Jung. The elementary thoughts were for Bastian universal ideas common to all humanity, ideas that at all times and among all peoples would have the same character, whereas for him the "popular thoughts" were particular forms that the system of elementary thoughts *must* have, under the diversifying influences of natural environments. The "popular thoughts" would thus represent a layer of creative and formative forces, beneath the different forms of culture. Probably no one would accept Bastian's ideas today, because they are too naive and simplistic. It is worth noting that Durkheim's critique was precisely an argument against the positions held by Bastian and Wilhelm Wundt with his *Völkerpsychologie.*

Leaving aside for the moment questions of tradition, we shall indicate a few features of the ancient history of Normandy. It is well enough known that the name of Normandy is due to the Danish and Norwegian Vikings who pillaged this region around the year 800, and subsequently settled in the country. In 911, their leader Rollo (Gange Rolv) received the country as a fief from Charles the Simple, and the Norman state was established. There have been quarrels between Danish and Norwegian historians over the respective importance of the two peoples in this enterprise; and especially, of course, as to the probable origin of Rollo. This dispute is apparently as futile as the one about the Pope's beard. All that has been proven is the participation of two peoples; and the fact, indicated by documents, that the Vikings of Vestfold, southwest of Oslo, attacked France on several occasions (the Westfaldingi).

One is better informed about the development of this new Norman state. One knows the profound influence that this new sovereignty had on the social and cultural structure of the country; and moreover, on the political and cultural development of all of Western Europe. Not the least of which being the seizure of England by William the Conqueror in 1066, as well as the Viking possessions in southern Italy and Sicily, and their participation in the Crusades. Their Norman fiefs were conquered by Philip Augustus in 1204 and subjected to the French Crown in 1364. This did not prevent Normandy from enjoying throughout the Middle Ages an autonomy that gave its local culture a strong distinctiveness; which manifested itself among other things through the unparalleled efficiency of its administration.

Of all these facts, the Nordic memory has above all retained the particular forms that Romanesque architecture received from the "Norman style", which was to dominate England, and which deeply propagated its influence in the Scandinavian countries.

This new impetus takes nothing away from the fact that tradition in Normandy has retained multiple elements of its Nordic origins, both in language and in customs. Place names like Turville still recall the god *Tur* or *Tor* in whom, according to the ancient documents of Normandy, the Vikings had faith.

A legend, which finds its poetic form in an ancient French poem, tells that Arletta, the mother of William the Conqueror, at the moment she gave birth to him, dreamed: "A tree grew from my body. It rose towards the sky. It cast its shadow over all of Normandy." This is a copy of the legend of "The tree of Queen Ragnhild", the tree that appeared in the dream of the wife of a small local king of Norway, Halvdan Svarte, at the moment when his son Harald Haarfager was born, who was to unite Norway under his authority. She dreamed that she was in her garden, and that she was removing a thorn from her dress. At the moment when she held it in her hand, this thorn began to grow, to become a great tree. The tree touched the ground, took root there and rose very high into the sky. At the bottom, the tree was red as blood, higher up the trunk was a brilliant green, and the branches were white as snow. It had many strong branches, some high and some low. The boughs of the tree extended so far that they covered all of Norway.

The heroic poems of the songs of the Edda found a renaissance in Normandy, and made their contribution to the compositions of the heroic poetry of the French Middle Ages, but by abandoning the Nordic language, which was replaced very quickly by French. Already the son of Rollo, Wilhelm Langsvärd, was obliged to send his sons to Bayeux to study the Nordic language, which had begun to deteriorate in Rouen. Far more important for tradition were the survivals of paganism which, independently of official Christianity, continued as an underground and illegal cult. It troubled and frightened the pious ecclesiastical souls greatly.

The mention of these few survivals of Nordic influence in Normandy is made with no other purpose than to show how traditions can retain ideas, or at least their symbolic forms, across incalculable periods; and to sketch a little the character of the traces that the Normans may have left on the new country where they settled. The historian of Normandy André Manguy was touching on the quick when he ended his book "Au temps des Vikings... les navires et la Marine Nordique d'après les vieux textes", published in 1944 under the German occupation, with these phrases that seemed in truth to launch an appeal to his "Scandinavian brothers": "to teach a reborn world everything that our ancestors meant by the word aere, which has a meaning close to the word honour — the true basis of social and moral life among the ancient Nordic people".

Probably the time has come to return to all these signs, so discreet, quasi-insignificant, engraved or carved on the walls of Norman churches. But, seen in the light of tradition, one must first recognise the synthetic, almost amorphous character of this unity of coherence in slow movement, in order to be able to situate the signs within this underlying unity in our attempt at evaluation.

The first impression that struck me when I saw these images was this: "Good heavens! Here is the entire gallery of subjects of the Scandinavian Bronze Age rock carvings." It is obviously tempting to try to establish the possibility of such a traditional coherence. The very idea may perhaps seem to most people to belong to a more than baroque dilettantism, since the normal method consists of analysing each subject taken separately, in isolation, and in this way it is naturally easy to explain that "circles have been made always and everywhere", or boats, or figures, or hearts, or... etc. One is certainly right in the sense that such a hypothesis can in no way be proved by following the classical demonstration of probability methods. Nevertheless, we have shown abundantly enough how tradition is capable of an incredibly tenacious vitality, and one more fundamental condition must be kept in mind: *when a tradition is transplanted into a new environment, it is often marked by a tendency to ossify, to* harden and to close in upon itself in an immutable form. We have an example of this in the astonishing conservatism of the Nordic language in Iceland and in the Faroe Islands. One senses the rupture of contact with the place of origin. Norwegian writing was never so perfectly Danish as after the dissolution of the union in 1814. It was only after 1907 that it slowly began to recover its original character.

It is undeniable that in leafing through these images one finds, so to speak, the entire repertoire of subjects of the Bronze Age rock carvings, obviously in a somewhat attenuated form. What characterises the Scandinavian rock carvings above all are subjects such as the boat, solar signs, cup-shaped hollows interpreted as offering cups, horses, ploughing scenes, stags, snakes, men in various attitudes and situations and horsemen, footprints and handprints. This entire world is present on the walls of the churches of Normandy. Various subjects of the rock carvings are obviously missing, notably the fir tree — the eternally green tree — as a symbol of fertility whose importance is naturally secondary in a country of deciduous forests (unless numbers 62, 127, 128, 131 and 178 can be interpreted as fir trees). The chariot, so widespread in the rock carvings, is also missing. The most striking thing in these Norman-Scandinavian connections is the resemblance that may exist in the very forms of each sign. This is what we shall study in our commentaries on the individual images.

No doubt is any longer permitted regarding the fact that the Nordic rock carvings of the Bronze Age represent a fertility cult linked to agriculture. The sun takes a dominant place here. The sun that traverses the sky during the night in its boat, but which, by day, rolls with the solar horse, as is expressed in the most fitting manner by the famous solar chariot of Trundholm, dating from the first Danish Bronze Age.

The tradition of the solar boat has evidently been maintained in the North until an incredibly late period. In my own youth, before and during the First World War, it was strangely important for us, in the village in western Norway where I spent my young years, to find an old boat to place at the top of the Midsummer bonfire. I think there is no objection to the idea of considering the fire of the summer solstice night as a festival whose origin lies in the solar cult. No one among us knew why, nor paused to think about what made it indispensable to have this boat. It had to be there, that is all. There were certain years when it was a hard ordeal before we managed to beg enough to obtain an old rowing boat for our ceremony. Later I learned that the same ritual took place in other parts of the country.

On this subject, there is a study to be made on the question of the presence of boats in churches. The old hypothesis, which still holds, according to which they represent *ex-voto* offerings from sailors who survived shipwrecks, is not sufficient.

It should be noted that the ritual bonfires of the summer solstice belong to an ancient and general tradition in the North. From it derives the one that takes place on the island of Runöe in old Estonia, and it is claimed that it goes back to old Swedish influences. Such traditions are unknown to me in Normandy, I must confess. James G. Frazer however mentions in his famous work "The Golden Bough" a strange custom in Saint-Lô, where a burning human effigy is thrown into the river, where it floats away while being devoured by fire. This tradition has been interpreted (by Oscar Almgren) as a mixture of the custom of burning the god of fertility on the bonfire of the year, and his disappearance on the sea in a boat.

Thanks to its important role in the sun's journey across the sky, the horse also sometimes takes its place among the solar signs, but the horse remains above all the image of procreative force. This is a phenomenon common to all the Indo-Europeans, well known in the ancient Hindu rites where this symbolism presents itself with extraordinary evidence. The *Rigveda* signifies the sun as a disc or a wheel pulled across the sky by the horse *Etaca* (the swift) harnessed directly to the disc. The horseshoe that is found on two of the images in this book (numbers 76 and 77) thus has the function of signifying the horse.

The connection between the horse and the boat is manifested with evidence. It is not by chance that in the ancient Edda, in Nordic poetry, the boat is continually called a horse: "horse of the sea", "horse of the waves", etc. It is an idea that finds its origins at least in the Bronze Age. A rock carving at Østfold in Norway shows a boat upon which several solar signs are superimposed. The prow is formed unmistakably as a horse's head, with a long flowing mane, while the stern of the boat is a horse's tail.

The stag also presents itself as a solar sign. The *sólarhjortr* of the Eddas, the sign of the celestial god *Ty.* On a rock carving from Bohuslän, in Sweden, two stags are linked by a band, or something similar, and one bears a solar wheel on its antlers. And even this image is among those that have a very great extent.

The solar sign, in itself, is often a wheel with four spokes. Concentric circles are also common (cf. numbers 24 and 27). Sometimes one encounters two concentric circles, with closely spaced rays between them (cf. number 91). Sometimes the circle itself is composed of a dense gathering of cup-shaped hollows (number 92). It happens that a figure is represented with a solar wheel in place of a head (number 92). One is here in the presence of the anthropomorphised solar god in person on the arena of the rock carvings. One often sees one or more solar wheels passing directly above a boat (cf. number 39), or being pulled by the solar horse.

In Norway at least, it is striking how often one encounters rock carvings in places called *Solberg,* the solar mountain. Everything leads one to believe that such names are so ancient that they were attached to the sacred mountains where the sun was venerated. The carvings are also found in places called *Helgaberg* and *Helgastein,* the sacred mountain and the sacred stone.

The links between the solar cult and the fertility of the earth are easy to detect, considering how the carvings are carefully placed on rocks surrounded by cultivable land, or on cliffs facing pieces of land possessing this character. It is therefore natural that one often finds ploughing scenes among the carvings. That these involve religious agrarian rites is clearly revealed on a carving from Bohuslän, where the cultivator holds in his hand while working a small fir tree. Its eternal greenness was the sign of the fertility of the earth across large regions of Europe. We often find the fir tree as an autonomous image on the rock carvings. It even seems to have survived its encounter with Christianity in Germany, where it was known throughout the Middle Ages, and from where it subsequently found a renewed spread across Europe as well as North America, as a Christmas tree. Even this ploughman, we find him here (number 94). He works with a wheeled plough, used for a long time throughout Europe. It was brought to England by the Angles and the Saxons.

Footprints constitute an extremely common subject in rock carvings. Handprints are also found there, but more rarely. We are here before a representation that is virtually universal, because the footprints of men and animals are found almost everywhere on earth, and handprints are at least as widespread. In Europe this representation goes back to the most ancient Palaeolithic art. Without commenting on the discussions about the interpretations that have been advanced for these signs, normally based on conjectures, one must nonetheless mention the fact that they both form part of the ensemble established in the subjects of the rock carvings as well as of the churches of Normandy (numbers 68–76, 78–83).

One encounters from time to time, on the rock carvings, a figure who has enormous hands. He has been named "the god with the great hands". Doctor Just Bing considered that he represented one of the two great Indo-European gods, who was "the god of fire" and "the god of the sky" (the "god with the great hands" corresponding to the first mentioned). But his arguments were, once again, so founded on his desires that there is hardly any reason to retain them. There are, on the contrary, every reason to draw attention to the strange figures with large hands, numbers 84 and 85. Number 84 presents a special interest, being additionally equipped with a large spiral "solar form" on its belly.

The most widespread subject of the rock carvings of the North remains the cup-shaped hole, interpreted as an offering cup. In rock art, it is a subject as widespread throughout the world as footprints and handprints. The holes are found gathered by the thousands, and often placed in a precise compositional relationship. They can form solar images. On a carving from Bohuslän there is a large wheel where the interior intervals are lined with densely packed holes. Is it the celestial wheel with the stars? A primitive zodiac?

Who knows? On a Norwegian carving from Østfold we see a narrow and long path, composed of holes, that climbs along the mountain to surround a solar sign. Is it the Milky Way? It does not seem that an absolute dependence is logically necessary between the holes and the solar cult proper, and at the very least, not directly between them and the agrarian cult of the earth, since one finds these holes among the rock carvings far up in the high mountains, in Norway, where any possibility of cultivation is excluded or, at best, would have met with extremely unfavourable conditions, even in the warm climate of the Neolithic era and the Bronze Age.

Yet another subject, dear to the rock carvings, is the snake. It is found placed on the boat as well as before men in postures of adoration. It too participates in the general cult of the sun and of fertility. On the work calendars (the runic sticks) in Sweden, the day of the spring equinox — 21 March — is sometimes represented by a snake (Östergötland and Kalmarfief), and sometimes by a plough (Uppland). This established connection is not without interest since a rock carving from Bohuslän shows a close combination between a snake and a plough. Fertility and death are but two sides of the same thing, and in this relationship the snake plays a considerable role in Nordic beliefs, as well as in those of Russia. But since the snake forms part of the group of the great universal signs, its particular interpretation over a limited area is very difficult to establish. The connection with this world is seen in numbers 10, 30–31, 33–35.

Thus we have examined the close connections between the principal subjects of the Nordic rock carvings and those of the walls of the churches of Normandy; this naturally does not at all imply that a direct connection between the two has been proved. Seen against the background of all that has just been explained on the subject of traditions and their behaviour in general, it seems however that we may observe that all of this reveals at least a problem whose solution would be of quite considerable interest.

In the event that such a direct connection were suspected, there is in any case one important reservation to formulate. It is absolutely out of the question that the religious philosophy of the Bronze Age could have been a conscious spiritual force in the Normandy of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. What could have been, at that time, the conscious interpretation of these signs? Is it possible, for example, that the connection between the sun and the image of the church could be envisaged for a landscape purpose (numbers 160–161)? Against this possibility speaks the fact that the solar sign is found in combinations where such interpretations have very little natural basis. Its connection with crosses indicates other avenues of interpretation.

Analytically, the study that I present here has two bases of equal importance: the principle of complementarity highlighted previously and the concept of field. The latter was developed by the American psychologist Kurt Lewin, "Topological psychology". Having become aware that no sociocultural system is a closed and isolated system, I believe I have sufficiently emphasised the dynamic value of this concept of field. There is no closed field. There is always superposition, juxtaposition, "overlappings" between systems. The permanence of a field of tension implies the existence of real possibilities of transformation and renewal. The thesis that I developed in "Socioculture" (1956) seems to us to be in a perspective close to the "situlogy" of Mr. Jorn, a situlogy conceived as a dynamic or experimental topology.

The non-traditional examination of the nature of intellectual consciousness reveals the importance of the principle of complementarity. Let us take up again the classical image of consciousness. A lighthouse whose narrow beam of light successively sweeps the entire horizon. From any sector of this horizon, and however considerable the light projected by attention may be, it would be impossible for us to have any image of it if the rest of the horizon did not simultaneously remain present as if by the glow of a nightlight. An essential complementarity that is inscribed in the very simultaneity of these two different levels of consciousness, one precise, the other diffuse.


## A LETTER...

During my stay in the South of France, I carefully read the two prefaces written, for the collection of graffiti photographs, by Messrs. Glob and Gjessing. Now I find myself very embarrassed about writing something in my turn on these documents, for I am not entirely in agreement with Messrs. Glob and Gjessing on the meaning that should be given to these documents. One would need, first of all, to study their provenance. Were they engraved on stones that were subsequently used in the construction of the church? Or were they engraved when the stone was already placed in a wall? It seems certain to me that masons, in former times, willingly drew with a point on the stones they were about to use, or that they had just used. They still do so today, but with their site pencil. On the other hand, idle people (soldiers standing guard, passers-by) certainly also traced such graffiti. For my part, I completely exclude the hypothesis of an esoteric significance, attesting to the survival, conscious or unconscious, of prehistoric or protohistoric beliefs. At most, in certain cases, one can think of crude ex-votos; one would then need to see whether the drawing is related to the patron saint of the church and to the virtues or healing power attributed to him.

The hypothesis of survivals from the paganism of the Vikings, alleged by Mr. Gjessing, is contrary to everything that the historical sources teach us.

## MORONIC VANDALISM: GRAFFITI MANIA

*Louis REAU.*  
*Excerpt from* The History of Vandalism.  
*Librairie Hachette, 1959.*

*Stupidity plays a dominant role in the emergence of a childish variety of vandalism, fairly benign in appearance but particularly irritating, which is called graffiti mania. André Hallays also calls it parietal graphomania. But graffiti mania is not exercised only on walls.*

*"There exists," wrote André Hallays with anger, who was one of the most ardent defenders of our monuments in peril, "a race of vandals more odious and more stupid than the revolutionaries: they are the monomaniacs of the graffito." Innumerable indeed are the fools who, armed with a stick of chalk or a penknife, aspire to immortalise their stupidity by inscribing their obscure names on the portals of churches, the faces of recumbent effigies or the mirrors of national palaces.*

*This deplorable mania does not date from yesterday. The ashes of Vesuvius have preserved at Pompeii and Herculaneum graffiti of all kinds: electoral or obscene, dating from the 1st century of our era. Their antiquity cannot serve as an excuse for modern graffiti maniacs.*

*That amorous couples devote themselves to carving their initials or hearts pierced by arrows on the bark of trees is tolerable enough. But this small change of vandalism is not the monopoly of children, sentimental strollers and tourists. There is the advertising vandalism of poster-pasters who dishonour sites and monuments with their obsessive advertisements, the political graffiti mania of nocturnal defacers of walls and pavements: Mussolinian fascists or Stalinist communists who soil the facades of public buildings with their indelible slogans in tar and red lead. Legislation that is too lenient towards this type of degradation encourages abuses that it should severely repress.*

*Thus all the base instincts that slumber in the murky depths of the subconscious, but which only await the opportunity to rise to the surface and be unleashed like the venomous "locusts" of the Apocalypse emerging from the pit of the abyss, all the evil spirits of destruction, pillage, lucre, envy, superstition and vengeance share in turn the responsibility for the ravages of vandalism.*


## SAVAGERY, BARBARISM AND CIVILISATION

ASGER JORN

### THE NORDICS

All the ignominious possibilities of human behaviours and conduct are incarnated and made concrete in a small number of situations and in a few simple acts. The words that name these acts and elementary situations are neither scholarly nor numerous. VANDAL, BARBARIAN, a few others still, and the list is quickly closed: clear consciousness wishes to know nothing of them.

Horrible and monstrous facts and words — taboos — consciousness flees them, refuses intelligence the right to free examination, and methodically maintains towards them a long and persistent incuriosity. As proof of the latter, a single example: once incest was denounced and recounted, 2,000 years elapsed before anyone dared to seek out and say how it takes root in the heart of man.

The word VANDAL alone carries such emotional implications and arouses such horrified opposition — opposition that is entirely affective — that there is reason to think that the very mystery of the conduct it claims to designate is thereby thickened. This word is less a bearer of clarity than of obscurity.

It thus seems to me essential to finally place vandalism in its true light. And to account, as exactly as possible, for what is regarded as one of its most spectacular manifestations: the graffito.

Pride in a solidarity perhaps too violently felt? I dare say right away that I did not think without emotion, before these churches of Normandy, of the patient and laborious hands that carved, engraved, the stone. Furtive and trembling also — these hands — since it was a matter of something forbidden. To take pleasure in imagining that they might have been driven by the blindest passion — that of destroying — reveals, in my opinion, a profound aberration. And not only of mind but also of heart. The very one supposedly thus denounced.

*THE DANCE OF PALNA-TOKE, THE SPINN.*

*There are no traditional "archetypes" that do not reflect general laws of matter. The dancer, with one arm raised and the other lowered or placed on the hip, presents the classical pose of the whirling dervishes. The Bogomil sculptures in Yugoslavia link the dance to the legend of Tell, with the son, the apple and the archer.*  
*Dancer from Isère. The wheel above his head indicates rotation.*

*Bogomil Sarcophagy*  
*But these stones also possess a miraculous power! A monument in the environs of Ladjevica possesses the property of healing. A sterile woman who swallows a little powder scraped from this stone will become fertile. And the legend becomes a belief: the more or less large notches that the monument bears clearly testify to the attempts made to scrape particles from it. Who knows how many women have tried to cure their sterility in this way! A monument at Donja Stupa, bearing deep notches, is almost sunk into the earth. It is a sacred object throughout the region. This old monument preserves the village from all inclement weather, especially from hail.*  
*After Benac.*

The act of destroying never seems to us so pure — by which I mean so absolute — as when it involves stone. We must bear in mind that after having marked the ages of human prehistory, stone also occupied historical times, and this under an essentially dual usage: construction, destruction. All religions bear witness to the importance of these two antithetical functions: the Christian — building stone and stoning — the Islamic and others, in a symbolism less explicit but equally strong. This duality of its use is our very own ambivalence, which has been inscribed, over the course of millennia first, then centuries, in the only solid material that man knew for a long time.

The presence of stone is too fundamental a thing for us not to be sensitised to its negation, in an extreme manner. That it be ignored — simply used as a support by graffiti maniacs — or brought down by vandals — that is what we cannot bear, what scandalises us. And, at the same time, prevents us from understanding and knowing the approach and the motives of these authors of engraved and drawn signs and images; condemns us to know nothing of this impulse that drives certain men more than others to destroy.

Already excellent minds have applied themselves to ceasing to deprive clear consciousness of its means, to no longer preferring to blithely stigmatise the conduct of this people of the North — the Vandals — but to study the nature of an energy and the significance of a need — vandalism.

Their efforts have enabled the birth of vandalismology.

Knowing exactly how the Vandals lived and who they were, what were the trials, aims and difficulties of this people, this is what has become part of the problem. And, in an even more central way, the study of this same force, rage and aim: to destroy, to blindly destroy.

The word BARBARIAN has been made into a word supposedly designating those who obstinately refuse all rhetoric. There is no justification for this fact, except that in politics, the methods of Nordic parliamentarians are opposed to Latin speeches.

In France, in the popular sense, "la barbe" is an expression that conveys a boring and unpleasant situation. In Scandinavia, it designates an amusing and funny situation.

It has become possible, today, to perceive that the affective potential contained in the word VANDAL is an unfortunate gift of hereditary collective memory. This very memory, whose feats contemporary psychology has abundantly highlighted, has proven, on this precise point, fallible too. In fact, the synonymy of the words VANDAL and DESTROYER masks the conduct it claims to designate more than it serves or facilitates its clear representation. And then, even if this memory had transmitted nothing erroneous to us, I would not hesitate any more to make the following remark: in both biology and psychology, the faculty of forgetting and renewal are indispensable to life, if not to survival.

A science in formation, vandalismology already has its own methods and also its own history.

It is to a Frenchman, Louis Réau, that the credit goes for having endeavoured to catalogue and classify the various varieties of vandalism. Defining it as the destruction of monuments of historical significance or artistic character, he was able, based on its effects, to produce the following classification:

WITH UNAVOWED MOTIVES:

Sadistic vandalism: The brutal instinct of destruction;  
Greedy vandalism: Blind avarice of pillagers;  
Envious vandalism: Erasure of predecessors' traces;  
Intolerant vandalism: Religious and revolutionary fanaticism;  
Moronic vandalism: Graffiti mania.

WITH AVOWABLE MOTIVES:

Religious vandalism;  
Prudish vandalism;  
Sentimental or expiatory vandalism;  
Aesthetic vandalism of taste;  
Elginist and collector vandalism;

To this well-diversified classification, the English wished to add — under the impetus of Martin S. Briggs — an additional category: lack of maintenance, which would be considered a vandalism of negligence.

Vigorous opposition from the French who, rightly personalising the debate, refuse this possible opening to anonymity. Indeed, to be truly able to denounce vandalism, it seems essential to be able to indicate not only an act, but also a responsible agent. Assuming the latter point to be unnecessary, we would arrive, in a pantheistic country (or merely one with such tendencies), at the sight of the natural degradation of things, at a heresy of the sort: God is a Vandal.

Any heresy of this kind would quickly engender the temptation to consider oneself divine. The traditional mentality of the Danish province of Vendsyssel attests to this possibility.

The intransigence of the English positions and the traditional docility of Danish politicians and scholars towards these make us fear that the remarkable rise of vandalismology in the post-war years may, in the end, work against its very aims.

The history of the meaning of the word VANDAL is long. However, it is only in modern times that the meaning of this word will definitively become enclosed in the traditional clichés that we know today.

In 1739, in the heart of the Enlightenment, Voltaire noted the colonnade of the Louvre "masked and dishonoured by buildings of Goths and Vandals".

Forty-five years later, in August 1794, a former deputy of the Lorraine clergy, who had become a constitutional bishop — the Abbé Grégoire — used it in a report presented to the Convention (14 Fructidor Year III).

"Why did he choose to pillory the Vandals rather than the Goths, the Huns, the Philistines or the Boeotians?" asks Louis Réau, who explains:

"The Philistines were barbarians only in the eyes of their enemies, the Israelites; and the Boeotians were considered dull-witted only in comparison with the Athenians. The reputation for savagery of the Germanic hordes was on the other hand well established in Western Europe, victim of the great invasions. The Romans retained the memory of the Vandalica Rabies, one of the first bouts of furor teutonicus of which Rome had been a victim in 445. The Vandals had, for fifteen days, sacked the Eternal City."

During the Middle Ages, the popularity of the images of Samson's activity (destruction and displacement of monuments) does not call the Philistines themselves into question: Samson has not become one of the symbols of the fight against vandalism.

What hypotheses can be made about crimes of which no monument perpetuates the reality for us? No Vandal boastfulness. Unlike the Romans. One knows the monument that Titus had erected to commemorate the pillage of Jerusalem — a sacred city — and to show the importance of the booty. It would be very difficult for us if the Gauls, in their turn, had destroyed the Roman monuments that symbolised their defeat, to pronounce upon their vandalism.

The Napoleonic conquests and destructions were illustrated by short scenes, on the Vendôme column. But, under the Commune, the toppling of the tiresome column having engaged the responsibility of the painter Courbet, the French themselves do not know, today, where the vandal is.

That a nation should wish to commemorate the great deeds of its history through architectural ensembles is an essentially political fact. Without any connection to the architectural aesthetic reality. And which therefore in no way guarantees its value.

*RUSSIAN POPULAR IMAGERY*

Fig. 144. THE BEAR AND THE WOMAN. Copper engraving executed between 1820 and 1840. Dimensions 285 × 330 mm.

"A woman went to gather mushrooms in the wood — a bear with sharp teeth comes to meet her, he seizes her with his big claws. 'Will you, little mother, wrestle with me?' The woman replies: 'I am afraid, little bear, of tearing my skirt. It is not fitting for us to wrestle together.' She cried out to him: 'Stand back, bear, I have not the strength to resist.' She succumbs from fear, she is dishevelled, she tears her blouse and her skirt against a big clod of earth. When the bear saw the woman's skirt torn he went to look for string — he thought to patch the hole in the skirt with a strip of bark, but the woman lying on the ground cries: 'You will not be able to mend this tear.' The hare intended to come to her aid and to close the tear with its paws, but the woman let out such a sharp cry that the hare took fright and shouted very loudly: 'Run, run little bear, the woman's tear has become bigger.' On account of these cries, the bear had no more peace. It was agreed between them, so that there should be no quarrel, that the bear would try to leave as quickly as possible and would not come back. When he saw the woman's skirt torn he became almost crazed. On returning home, the woman told the grandfather of the fright she inspired in the bear. The wolves, the foxes and the other beasts were from then on in her eyes nothing but mice." This assonant text contains many obscurities. The erotic intentions that one perceives are reminiscent of the story told, in a very clear manner, by Rabelais.

One can no longer count the number of heroes whose memory is ill-served by the statuary that seeks to honor them, and there are entire cities whose architecture and statuary are monumental errors, if not horrors.

Furthermore, the herd instinct does not necessarily engender taste and aesthetic sense. The civilizing role of cities is neither evident nor absolute. It follows that the partial or total destruction of an urban ensemble does not necessarily constitute an act of vandalism.

My childhood in the land of origin of the Vandals and the Teutons left me with clear memories. I recall that the dark activity of the great industrial cities was considered satanic there. And I have not forgotten the stories that were told to us—Sodom and Gomorrah; and also: the Tower of Babel. All stories in which God was present; and through which is expressed a state of mind and equally a moral position, whose reasons and validity it seems to me, as an artist, essential to rediscover rather than to oppose in a blind and categorical manner.

Louis Réau pays unreserved homage to the Romans for their colonization of Gaul—"a work of civilization, in the noblest sense of that word"—but he then radically changes his position toward the Nordic invaders, particularly toward the Normans. And when he then asks himself what can be credited to them, he discovers only one thing: "the birth of Romanesque architecture, which the English prefer to call, not without reason, the Norman style." Let us recall in passing that this Norman style appeared to the humanists of the Italian Renaissance to be of indescribable ugliness—a barbaric, "Gothic" phenomenon.

*"Christians eat God out of love for the divine; they commune in theophagy. The humanispherians push the love of humanity to the point of anthropophagy: they eat man after his death, but in a form that has nothing repugnant about it, in the form of a host, that is to say in the form of bread and wine, of meat and fruits, in the form of food," explains the anarchist Joseph Dejacque. Testimony to the cyclical spirit that dominates anarchism, and which corresponds strangely to the agrarian spirit of the Neolithic. There lies the origin of the rituals of the host, in the cults of the last sheaf, the subject of several menhirs, supposed to contain the entire power of fertility of the field.

### CHURCH-EATING VANDALISM

There was, in Byzantium, a very important religious vandalism — vandalism that Louis Réau only imperfectly succeeded in distinguishing and isolating. Certain priests scraped the icons, detached particles from them which they collected in a chalice, for the purpose of giving communion to the faithful. These icons — summits of the religious art of the era — were thus truly delivered to consumption.

This fetishism of absorption was the cause of the meaning and significance of art being changed and obscured.

To halt this vandalism of nutrition that had become ritual, the Emperor decreed iconoclasm; all those who possessed, privately, icons, were invited to come and bring them to Constantinople where, in the public square, they were burned. This was obviously remedying one form of vandalism with another: that of sacrifice, of potlatch.

However, this governmental vandalism cannot be compared to the first — popular — one.

In the first case, it is a matter of a festival. This consumption — however naive it may have been — contained authentic elements of love and faith: it was happy vandalism.

P. V. Glob reports to us, among other cases, that of cake-images whose perfect absorption implied the destruction of human beings, hence a certain cannibalism. Anthropophagy belongs more precisely to Teutonism, of which it reveals, aberrantly, the will towards purity and aestheticism. And it is the aberrations of this will that are found again in the Vandalic domain — a domain where the historical data oblige us to establish similar categories.

Emile Mâle in his work "La fin du paganisme en Gaule", informs us of the celebrity — in medieval and Nordic France — of the tomb of the Merovingian bishop Saint-Drausin. This tomb, today preserved in the Musée du Louvre, was originally in the church of Notre-Dame in Soissons. Knights who were to fight in single combat stayed near it, and Saint Thomas of Canterbury, on the point of returning to England where he knew he would have to confront Henry II, kept vigil of arms there. Coming on pilgrimage, the faithful had the custom of taking away some particles of the lid, which they diluted in water and gave to the sick to drink. This custom, which continued for centuries, caused the lid to disappear almost completely. The one currently seen at the Louvre is not the original, but another which is Visigothic and comes from the church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

In Spain as well, the tombs of the Visigothic kings show traces of the same activity.

We are obliged to observe that we are no longer simply here within the notion of sacrifice inherent in all art, but rather face to face with an avowed sarcophagy. We must think that it was the Germanic peoples who spread this custom of absorption of sarcophagi by oral means.

The similar destructions of the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs would more likely have been the work of North African vandals. Moreover, the very extent of these destructions leads us to suppose that the export to Germanic Europe of this substance so greatly prized by the pharmacopoeia of the Middle Ages was highly organised.

The deformations of the walls of Norman churches — especially at Damville — seem to bear witness to this surprising variety of vandalism. And I do not believe I am venturing much in advancing that the Normans, landing in Gaul, introduced there the ancient Germanic custom of ingesting symbolically sacred materials. Materials which also included the walls of religious buildings.

Henceforth, the mystery of the relationship between the Templars and the Norman graffiti (especially those of Gisors: imprint of bare feet) is clarified. It is no longer possible to retain an accusation against them — even an implicit one — of a desire for concealment and secrecy: simply, the Templars were sarcophagous.


### THE BEARSKINS - THE JOMSVIKINGS - THE TEMPLARS

The oldest chess sets in Europe are of Scandinavian origin.

One of them — which now resides in the British Museum — was found on the Isle of Man, and represents a warrior devouring a shield.

This particular type of eater is well known from the Viking chronicles. He belonged to a warrior corps — the Jomsvikings or "bachelor warriors" whose mythical chief was Palna-Toke, related to both William Tell and Till Eulenspiegel the fool. The Jomsvikings were also known under the name of Bersærk — "the bearskins". It was said that they drew their delirious fury from the consumption of a drug extracted from a mushroom.

We know that this warrior organisation, removed from the authority of kings, played a central and secret role in the Viking conquest of Normandy and England. It seems possible to me to advance that the organisation of the Templars was, in fact, a reorganisation of the Jomsvikings.

A skilful mixture of unscrupulous journalism and facts that are in themselves remarkable — the work of Gérard de Sède is entirely steeped in a mysticism and an esotericism that some will describe as dubious and unpleasant. However, the reputedly informed specialists are quick to criticise the lack of seriousness of the positions that the method used by de Sède necessarily establishes (also by the review *Planète).* And these specialists withdraw with dignity.

One cannot, however, identify as "sensationalist press" — no reader has ever been mistaken about this — works that bring something new, true, astonishing. Where according to certain suspicious minds there is trickery, we must see a process of purification indispensable to progress.

The fault perhaps lies with the exclusive taste for literal explanation that the Scandinavians have, but I feel quite incapable of contemplating the fate of the Templars with the seriousness that the French bring to it.

The Templars were the defenders of a theocracy doomed in advance to failure, because based on a religion that is not of this world.


### THE TOUCHSTONE

Neither erosion on the one hand, nor the Normans' will for ingestion on the other, are sufficient to explain why the stone of Norman buildings was gnawed and worn to such an extent.

Attached to the act of sharpening — and for centuries — an important sexual symbolism leads us to think that the stone of the church walls was used there as a whetstone. Oral tradition confirms this usage — both for weapons and for agricultural tools used for the harvest.

The act of sharpening was a sacred act.

To my knowledge, there are few studies on this subject. However, Professor Michel de Bouard confirms that the whetstone was an object often present in the tombs of Merovingian warriors.

The most spectacular is the one in the shape of a sceptre with several heads, found at Sutton Hoo. As a symbol of male sexuality, it is of great interest and directly related to the myths concerning Odin. Especially with the myth according to which Odin seized the drink Kvasir contained in three vessels hidden by the giant Suttung and guarded by the latter's daughter — Gunlod. It was after sharpening the scythes of nine men (who subsequently killed one another) that Odin, transformed into a serpent, drilled a hole through the mountain, and slithered to the girl and to the treasure.

The stone that Norman peasants carry, during the harvest, in a horn attached to their belt, seems to us to correspond to the Nordic version of the sign of the Grail. These same peasants are keen to specify that they keep the stone moist by urinating in the horn. An imaged representation by graffito number 91. A pagan interpretation of the sign of the Grail.

### WHETSTONE - RUNIC HEART MIMIR - BAPHOMET

Urination and whetstone are found again in the Nordic myths of Thor and Hrungnir.

The Skáldskaparmál accounts mentioned by Georges Dumézil give us the details. It concerns the combat between Thor and Hrungnir. The latter has a heart, head and shield of stone and possesses in addition — as an offensive weapon — a whetstone (let us note that his heart is of a form that later became that of the sign of Odin). Flanked by a clay mannequin supposed to represent him, he goes to the appointed place for the combat and awaits Thor there.

When the latter arrives, the clay man is so frightened, it is said, "that he pisses at the sight of Thor". Thor smashes Hrungnir's whetstone with his hammer (a fragment of which will lodge itself in his head), then shatters his skull; but carried along in Hrungnir's fall, he also falls and finds his neck trapped beneath one of Hrungnir's feet. To free Thor thus held prisoner, it will be necessary to call upon his son — a child aged three nights — who will succeed without difficulty. Thor will give Hrungnir's horse to his son as a reward and, for having done so, will receive a reprimand from Odin.

Georges Dumézil considers it possible that the *tricornate* character — a singular detail — of Hrungnir's heart should be ranked among the various triplicities of the adversaries opposed to the warrior hero, or to the God. These triplicities are typical, he adds, of numerous Indo-European legends: the three-headed adversary of the Indian Indra; of the Iranian Ferridûn; the three Curiatii defeated by the young Horatius; Geryon, adversary of Heracles; the three Meic Nechtain, adversaries of Cúchulainn; Meche with the triple heart killed by Mac Cecht.

For us, the symbolism of three is that of an active, sacred and dangerous number. It seems to us to signify time past, present, future. Somewhat like nine, which appears in the very ancient Germanic songs as signifying life and movement, but, in addition, the seal of fate.

We have already said that the whetstone seemed to us to be — by extension from the meaning of the bladed weapon — a symbol of male sexuality. The presence of the foot in graffiti further confirms us in this opinion.

The principal accusation brought against the Templars was, according to John Charpentier, that in all provinces they had idols. Which consisted of heads, some with three faces and others with a human skull.

John Charpentier does not think it unreasonable to believe that the Baphometic images of the Temple appeared in the guise of a kind of Janus. The cathedral builders also concerned themselves with this same Baphomet. In Jutland, stones from the Viking era have been found representing triple heads — one of them bearing *a third eye* on its forehead; it is thought that this is a representation of Mimir, who had received the eye of Odin (for wisdom). (See ill. 219.)

Through all these various facts and clues, we are led to suppose that, in every case, it is a matter of this famous whetstone lodged in the god's forehead.

A study of the history of the Jomsvikings and their connections with the medieval knightly orders would fill a great gap. A study of the cult of the whetstone is also lacking.

Silence on these two points does not permit the discovery of connections other than superficial ones between the Templars and the Norman graffiti.

This mystery must be lifted, a factor of troubled judgement, and we must denounce, with regard to this particular case, the contempt that official positions traditionally affect towards everything that exceeds the general framework of an era.

We do not have the impression that the account of this combat — of this confrontation — was made by a neutral and impersonal witness, but rather that the narrator himself was engaged in the adventure that is told to us. Who is he? In our opinion: an adversary of Odin, therefore Thor. The hypothesis according to which Thor would be the narrator accords fairly well with the accounts of the era when peace reigned between Thor and Odin. It also explains Odin's reprimand as corresponding to the traces, in his memory, of their long previous hostility. Let us return to the ideas dear to us: in every conflict, there are always three elements and only one of them plays — on the psychological level — the role of victim. I am thinking here of the one decapitated by the stone fragment in the forehead. Let us call him Mimir, the wisdom that possessed the eye of Odin. What could he have told us?

Let us try to identify his story with that of Baldr, killed by the blind Hoder whom Loki assisted. Let us note in passing that this myth has strange connections with that of Palna-Toke — founder of the organisation of the Jomsvikings — and of William Tell, both shooting an arrow at an apple placed on the head of their son. Hoder's use of mistletoe as an arrow reveals certain possible links with the Celtic world. However, many other elements indicate that this cult is pre-Celtic; linked to the Ibero-Ligurian Neolithic culture. In this, one finds the name of Baldr in the form of Bellin. Curiously, a phallic statue bearing this name was discovered in the south of France by an archaeologist named Bellin. His account is most amusing, for Mr. Bellin is completely unaware of the popular use made, in Liguria, of this word with phallic meaning.

It is of irresistible interest for an artist to discover the relationship that unites Bellin with the concept of belleza: beauty linked to bellicose aggressiveness — which is strongly reminiscent of the idea of Shiva. The origin of this word is not Latin. There are no traces in the Germanic languages either, except the word *schön* whose equivalent in the Scandinavian language *kön* means both sex and beauty.

That Scandinavian also has a third word to express beauty — the word smuk — does not seem to me to be due to chance. In India, the very ancient Harivamsha calls the pre-Aryan deity Vayupurana "Smukha Trishira", that is to say "the beautiful one with three heads". It is also in India that one finds the phallus with three heads in the form of the Linga symbol — the sign of Shiva. Another of these three-headed statuettes was found in Dalmatia, at Zdrapanj, not far from a mountain called "Svante-vit" — which means: "to see all". Now, "Svante-vit" is the name of a statue found at Rügen which was a Jomsviking centre. We know of another, which comes from Husiatyn, in Poland. In terms of forms, we observe numerous resemblances between the three-headed figure of the pre-Aryan culture of Mohenjo-daro — a figure seated in the yoga position — and "the Celtic gods".

Although the desire is not lacking, we shall not linger to elaborate an aesthetics from the fundamental forms of this statuette, for the history of this image awaits us. And it holds in store for us surprises of burning actuality.


### THE THREE AND ITS IMAGE IN SECULARITY

In his work "Die dreiköpfige Gottheit", Willibald Kirfel advances that the origin of this image of the triple-headed god goes back to the pre-Celtic, megalithic (or Neolithic) era and that it has its place in the Mediterranean cultural world. Among the African Yoruba people, it is called Shango — the god of thunder — and is linked to secret organisations. It is found almost everywhere in the world.

Frobenius asserts that through the number three is expressed the feeling and the idea of Time: past, present, future, and that the number four is a projection into space of the directions of the flat surface. Frobenius's proposition seems to be corroborated by the existence of Spanish pictorial representations of the month of January: triple heads which, through their evident symbolism, refer us to secularity. The opposition of the Catholic church to the representation of the Trinity by a three-faced image finds its explanation there. The Christian concept of duality probably originates from the notion of contraries such as black and white and the double face of Janus (January).

The French Bibliothèque Nationale holds a drawing by Botticelli which illustrates one of the scenes from Dante's "Divine Comedy". Botticelli has depicted Dante beside a triple-headed devil. Dante writes: "Oh what a great subject of wonder it seemed to me when I saw that his head had three faces. One in front, and this one was red. The one on the right appeared between white and yellow. The one on the left was of an aspect similar to the faces of people come from where the Nile descends (that is to say between blue and black)."

Let us remember that the book for which Abelard was condemned concerned the Trinity, and that the oratory he had built, at Nogent-sur-Seine, was also consecrated to the Trinity.

*Titien: FROM THE PAST, THE PRESENT ACTS PRUDENTLY LEST IT MAR FUTURE ACTION!*

[Translator's note: This Latin inscription appears on Titian's famous painting *Allegory of Prudence* (c. 1550–1565), which depicts three human heads representing the three ages of man (youth, maturity, old age) above three animal heads (dog, lion, wolf). The maxim encapsulates the classical concept of Prudence: learning from past experience to act wisely in the present so as not to spoil the future.]

---


### PRUDENCE AND WISDOM

It is interesting to compare Botticelli's diabolical triple head with Titian's allegory of Prudence: an old man (himself), his son and his nephew; that is to say the Past of age, the Present of maturity and the Future of youth — a text which suggests that the Present can at once benefit from past experiences and not compromise future actions. In this image by Titian, Erwin Panofsky sees a prayer made by the painter to his son to leave his nephew every chance of fulfilment. Panofsky reports Giordano Bruno's penetrating analysis of the three faces of Time. All the analyses of this image by Titian — very simple in appearance — reveal conflicts of interpretation, passionate conflicts from which, paradoxically, Prudence is banished. All Western languages display, in their syntax, a Time divided into Past, Present and Future, forms to which every mind must necessarily grow accustomed and which, in practice, have become commonplace for all. Language, which decomposes for us, on the formal plane, Time into three different aspects, into three images of different moments, this language is for the mind a mould whose considerable importance has escaped us until recent years. Prisoners of language — it was long impossible for us to escape the Time that syntax represents to us. It decomposes into an apparently harmonious triplicity of pure Duration; that is to say that in fact it requires of us an important mental operation: that which consists in intuitively grasping that only one of the aspects — only one of the forms of Time is always opposable to the other two assembled. The concept of triplicity that assigns the same role to three elements conceals from us and masks the principle of antagonism: any given element is always opposable to the ensemble of the other two. Stéphane Lupasco has studied the structure of a particular antagonism — that of the static and the dynamic: "In order for any event whatsoever to take place, at any moment and at any place whatsoever in the Universe, it is necessary that an energy, a dynamism be able to pass from a certain state of potentialisation towards a certain state of actualisation, without which, rigorously actual or actualised, one could not even speak of energy, of dynamism, everything would be static, flat, from all eternity and for ever."

The triple polarisation of Time, as it appears in language, is indeed the image of this eternal stasis of which Lupasco speaks, who continues: "Thus all energy — every energetic movement — in whatever form — implies an antagonistic event and such that the actualisation of the one entails the potentialisation (the virtualisation) of the other." It is the union of any two of the aspects under which Time appears to us that has the power to actualise it and moreover, on the other hand, to virtualise or potentialise its third aspect. A capital consequence follows: the notion of Time conceals three different kinds of antagonisms, which are particularised according to the nature of whichever aspect of Time one chooses to oppose to the other two. We shall have the union of past-present opposed to its virtualised contrary: the future; then past-future opposed to the present; and finally present-future opposed to the past.

Lupasco declares: "An antagonistic couple of energetic events and anti-events constitutes — and it alone can constitute — a system, that is to say this ensemble of events linked and commanded by dynamic forces or relations intrinsic, inherent, to these events themselves. This is what I have formalised in a Logic of systems or Systemology. Numerous indeed are the possible combinations of these systems of systems, numerous their chains in arborescent expansion or systemogeneses; however, three are always formed."

In examining the structure of Latin culture, it seemed to me — and this before I had even become acquainted with the theories of Lupasco (who, moreover, does not address the problem of Time and its triple aspect) — it seemed to me then that this system of Latin structures involved an actualisation of the past-future, and a virtualisation of the present; that on the contrary Byzantine and Russian structures involved a present-future opposable to the past, and finally that Nordic structures were essentially the actualisation of the past-present and virtualisation of the future.

On the theological plane, the symbolism of the Trinity offers us a good opportunity to pinpoint with precision the opposition of the Aryanism of the Germanic peoples to the Romanity of the Latins: between Father and Son, a distinction of essences to which the latter are absolutely opposed. An opposition which, freed from all theological terminology, reappears today in Europe on the scientific, philosophical and artistic planes. The celebrated scientist and theorist Werner Heisenberg highlights in "Physics and Philosophy" the fact that "in classical theory, we assume that the future and the past are separated by an infinitely short interval of time that we can call the present. In the theory of relativity, we have learned that it is otherwise: the future and the past are separated by an interval of time that exists and whose duration depends on the distance between the observed phenomenon and the observer." One cannot better underline the fact that in classical theory the present has no dimension, that is to say no face, and therefore that time is then reduced to only two dimensions: a head of Janus. Relativity, which gives the present a dimension, makes of it an elective place of possible encounter between these two poles that the past and the future represent for us. Thus is established a time of dialogue: that of the necessary delay between question and answer —

Locke, who defines knowledge as being "the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas", leaves us in the difficulty of deciding by which antagonism the apprehension of the idea of the relativist present is effected: is it by the idea of the past or by that of the future? Assuredly neither of these two ideas can play a role alone, whereas their union in a single concept of past-future has the force of opposition — of antagonism — in relation to the present: "the properties of symmetry always constitute the most essential characteristics of a theory". Between the real — ultimate form of the present — and the possible — union of the past and the future — relations long mysterious are made explicit.

However, this fusion into a single concept of the past and the future, as well as the notion of antagonism, have just been vigorously criticised by a young Russian scientist, Mr. N. A. Kozyrev, who has declared that "there is no symmetry between action and reaction, that time can only pass in one direction: from past to future; and that the future is of a completely different essence from the past."


### HISTORY AND PROBLEM OF COMPLEMENTARY COLOURS

I thought that the approach to the problem would not be made any easier for me by Kozyrev's theories on oriented time, than by those of Lupasco on antagonisms, all these theories not being sufficiently familiar to me, and that consequently, the best approach would be, for me, the theory of colours. So I tried to find, in that direction, a new solution. The first obstacle encountered in this domain was the evidence of a conflict between Niels Bohr's theory of complementarities and the Hegelian and Marxist dialectic.

The notion of "complementarity" of colours had been perfectly defined long before Bohr undertook his studies. The word "complementary" designated contrasting colours placed at the two opposite ends of any diameter of the spectral circle. Colours which, mixed together, neutralise each other and always produce a similar grey, whatever the chosen diameter.

This polarisation of so-called "complementary" colours, which we judge preferable to call *contrasting,* seemed to obey marvellously the principles of the Hegelian dialectic — thesis, antithesis, synthesis. Using Lupasco's terminology, we shall name potential or virtual colours blue, yellow and red, which are on the spectral circle three irreducible sectors. These colours are opposed like the angles of a triangle, and not in a dual polarised antagonism. Red has as its contrary a mixture of yellow and blue — that is, green; blue, a mixture of red and yellow — that is, orange; yellow, a mixture of red and blue — that is, violet. These observations have allowed me to establish that every mixture is characterised as an actualised pole. Variability or play are the elements that the mixture reveals (in every case). Lupasco was unable — or unwilling — to take account of this definition, of this place given to play by every mixture, in his system. He made himself the prisoner of an antagonism limited to the opposition of the homogeneous and the heterogeneous. Antiquity already knew the triangular model of the three invariable constants. It appears through three superimposed triangles, forming a star, in the seal of Solomon called "the seal of Good and Evil". To trace the diagonals that connect them to one another is, on the plane of communication, to effect a reconciliation between Kant and Hegel.

The simultaneity of the awakenings of awareness in Lupasco, in Kozyrev and in myself seems to me to be historically significant, if one takes into account the fact that they occurred in an absolutely independent manner; Lupasco having had as his only concern a certain need for clarity in the logico-philosophical domain; Kozyrev, the desire to respond to certain astro-scientific requirements; and finally, myself, a purely artistic interest in the problem of colours — after Goethe and the painter Runge, the desire to better understand them.

Lupasco emphasises that light and "death" are synonymous. Now, in a Newtonian perspective, the different colours compose light: it follows that the world of colours extends beyond this limit constituted by "death". Goethe dismisses on this particular point all interest in the Newtonian theory by affirming that the division of light into colours is an inverse process — of materialisation, a tendency towards "life". It seemed to me that the ignorance and contempt in which scientists held Goethe's nonetheless impressive assertions necessitated and made possible the elaboration of a third theory of light, one that would be complementary to the other two.

The schema that I believed I should propose here — the Triolectic — was born from this critical examination of the Copenhagen interpretation, which I had entitled "the Silkeborg interpretation". The situlogy of which this schema is only a part, takes up the concept of analysis situs (Poincaré) but avoids giving too much importance to the notion of positional limit as it is formulated in topology. We judge indeed, with Gaston Bachelard, that in the concept of the situation, the event and time must be implied.


### TRIOLECTIC SCHEMAS

*A FEW EXAMPLES OF TRIOLECTIC COMPLEMENTARITY.*

*We present here a few models of triolectic equilibria applied to different conceptual domains. Let us emphasise that these are simple working bases, in no way dogmatic, which can be modified and expanded. It is in their nature to be open, beginning, for example, with a number greater than three relations, this method being obviously tied to no mystique of numbers. Its purpose is to liberate dialectical movements frozen either in sub-Marxist determinism or in the unchosen antagonisms in which Lupasco has become mired.*

![](/assets/books/signes-graves-eure-calvados/signes_graves-227.jpg)


### THE TRIOLECTIC SCHEMAS

*The future being the goal, and the present the instrument or the means, the past represents the result.*

*The triple possibility of fusion that the establishment of the three antagonisms imposes is presented thus:*

*Teleologism. The end justifies the means (fusion present-future);*

*Experimentalism. It is neither before, nor during the act that a justification can be effected, but only at the moment when the result is there.*

*The result justifies the means employed (fusion past-present).*

*Moralism. The goal merges with the result and the justification is opposed to both; the justification justifies itself because it is an instrumental means (fusion past-future).*

*One must be able to choose between these three dialectics. They cannot be conflated. Each possesses its own logic.*

The concepts formed from three elements in a static order risk remaining tainted with mystery and not being sufficiently clear for the mind; they require a more thorough study of the very conditions of their formation.

Two out of three of the given elements always correspond to this formation — which bring the antagonistic concepts into opposition. To be properly understood and properly executed, this mental operation requires that one fully realise that the totality of our concepts is affected by a dynamism proper to life.

This is why a sketch (even a rudimentary one) of the most elementary data of this concept formation appeared necessary to us. We have undertaken this work here, on the conclusions of which we nevertheless feel duty-bound to express the most explicit reservations. We have thus grouped in threes words that seem to us to be the basic elements of this formation of triple concepts. The list we give below does not claim to be exhaustive; however, thanks to this classification into a system, it perhaps becomes possible for each person to become aware of the antagonisms in which we inscribe, in an elective and symbolic manner, our conduct. Obviously, we are so accustomed to hearing and understanding these words in many senses other than those which relate solely to the dynamism of life, that it will certainly be disconcerting to find them here in their ideal static purity. We have classified them into three groups that preferentially correspond to the Latin, Germanic and Byzantine forms of structuring activities.

![](/assets/books/signes-graves-eure-calvados/signes_graves-230.jpg)

A Swedish scientist has shown that in optics the phenomenon of the transformation of triple contrasting colours is linked to the Gila tissue and that their juxtaposition takes place in this tissue. The study of the phenomenon is difficult because there is insufficient psycho-physiological information. Greater knowledge will allow a better approach to mental illnesses. Lupasco's theory has the very great merit of having highlighted the identity existing between the physical concept of potentiality and the ethical concept of virtuality.

The sacred and the taboo are word-concepts in which the ambivalence of ethics and theology on the one hand and the power of the blossoming Mana on the other appear particularly strong.

Between the sacred (virtualised) and the divine (actualised) we have established the existence of a certain antagonism — an antagonism which restores the word *Divine* to its original content: play — variation.

The history of all Christendom is, after all, nothing but the history of its division into complementary antagonisms, the history of the successive schisms of the church. Which have finally revealed three distinct domains, namely: the Greco-Byzantine church: present-future play; the Roman Catholic church: past-future; Nordic Protestantism: past-present. We have here three complementary concepts of the sacred: firstly, the concept of the past — which I shall call *"of production",* for in industrial society production and reproduction are equivalent; secondly, the concept of the present which is *"administration"*; and finally, thirdly, *"consumption"* which corresponds to the sacred future of the Protestants. Whatever it may cost us and whatever unease it may cause us, we must keep present in our minds these types of concepts, so formidably contradictory, since born of radically different mental processes. We must not let ourselves fall into the dangerous ease of believing it possible — with Raymond Aron — to harmonise a system of hierarchy of values (such as his) with the world of the free play of Max Weber. Let us refuse what would be a fallacious illusion. And let us not hide from ourselves that there is here an obligation of choice for anyone who wishes to prevent a cohesion built on misunderstandings and false agreements from shattering one day. A spectacle of which I ardently hope not to be the saddened witness...

To take the full measure of the drama currently being played out in people's consciences, one need only hear Stéphane Lupasco affirm without hesitation: "The whole of psychiatry must be revised". A declaration alongside which we immediately inscribe — with optimism — our triolectic system, eminently capable, in our view, of shedding some light on the functioning of the deep psyche, and of rationally accounting for the nature of the great mental illnesses hitherto incurable.

It is not our view (unlike Lupasco who seems to cultivate schizophrenia) that development should proceed from the concrete towards the abstract. Currently turned in an almost exclusive manner towards popular art, the plastic arts manifest at least by this very impulse a health that it would be futile to deny them.

Among other antagonisms with which Lupasco is preoccupied, there is one by which his thought seems to become particularly imprisoned, it seems to us: that of space and time. "The simultaneity of certain cerebral events engenders the notion of space", Lupasco assures us. Now, we have known for a long time — let us say since Heisenberg — that the notions of space and time are not foreign to each other but that on the contrary they are identical notions, the present being itself also simultaneity. Between question and answer there is inscribed a delay, a duration that is the present itself, the real being space. Should the delay between question and answer lengthen, the present will grow all the more — this at the expense of the past and the future. At the limit, we would find an absolute, integral, eternal present: "Waiting for Godot".

The false and illusory possibility of introducing some equilibrium into the antagonism of time and space has been denounced, with subtle efficacy, by Kozyrev who has shown us what the differences of essence are between the components (the past, the future) of the notion of time.

The sense of the sacred evolves and the notion of the divine also undergoes metamorphoses. The diversity of these transformations could lead one to believe in progress in Art, so much are our affective or mental dispositions sometimes changed by them. Suddenly we no longer recognise ourselves in this or that spiritual kinship, in this or that intellectual family. Yes, we are unstable: in turn equally drawn towards the ancient arts or towards the new arts. This does not prevent the complex man from thus seeking — within ourselves — his path towards life.

Should I have somewhat succeeded, on the example of one of these transformations, in making visible the immutability of its mechanism (immutable like the scale of colours), then my attempt will not have been entirely in vain.

One readily and commonly attributes to progress — to industrial progress — the transformation of the material conditions of Man's life. There is perhaps in this a heedless levity that future generations — if not ourselves — risk paying dearly for. For this "progress" is strangely, formidably invasive. If one wishes to prevent its monstrously inhuman effectiveness from growing without limit, and its power from extending to infinity, and man from becoming the frightened victim of a demented holocaust, we must remain the masters of the thousand material circumstances that form the weft of our daily life. Maintain them at our service. And not pass into theirs. An imperious alternative where the life of each person sometimes becomes mired, sometimes flourishes, and from which alone — let us say it — the artist with the creative spirit truly frees himself.

Indeed, after Blake and Turner who saw in the dream the pledge and guarantee of all truly accomplished human existence and courageously charged it with the weight of their own lives; truly creative artists have taken this path where invention is queen and truth the mandator. It is in the power of no religious or ideological, spiritual or material force to subject to its law the vitality of creative spirits. For such spirits bear witness above all to their freedom. Their strength is not of an instrumental nature. Were it to become so, they would cease — as spirits — to exist.


### THE TRIOLECTIC PRINCIPLE OF COMPLEMENTARITY

Lupasco declares:

"As such — as dynamic — the antithetical elements possess the constitutive property of the very notion of dynamism... The logic of the contradictory is a tridialectic, it engenders three dialectics that command one another."

Disjunction: it is the very mechanism of the dialectic: No dialectic without disjunction, and no disjunction without dialectic.

OUR TRIOLECTIC THESIS PRESENTS ITSELF AXIOMATICALLY AS FOLLOWS:

We have previously demonstrated how and why these three dialectics are inevitable. By placing alongside tridialectical dynamism its corresponding complementary and triolectic statics, we have revealed the subtle mechanisms that govern them.

Each disjunction is followed by a conjunction and, likewise, each conjunction is followed by a disjunction.

Fusion creates fission (actualisation is the name given by Lupasco to this conjunction or fusion).

Each compromise isolates and virtualises the opposite attitude.

We have chosen to call *the creation of a situation* (mise en situation) the formation of an antagonism or a contradiction.

The basic elements necessary for the birth of any given situation can be arranged so as to form two situations equally different from and complementary to the first.


### NORDIC BARBARISM

The antagonism between culture and civilisation is not one of the least important sources of conflict in the modern world; this is why it seems to me necessary to elucidate as much as possible the mysteries enclosed in these notions.

One can consider culture as the actualisation of a past-present (what is also called "tradition" or "custom") and civilisation as the actualisation of a past-future (what is called "historicity" or "chronology"). These two systems, linked by the antagonisms proper to them and which have as their potential either a present or a future, seem to us to manifest by their opposition the very diversity of the European North and South.

Louis Réau sees in vandalism one of the modalities of a much more important general phenomenon: barbarism.

In this, he distinguishes three great groups: *Teutonism,* *Gothicism* and *Vandalism.*

The first group corresponds to the unscrupulous destruction of conquered peoples; the second to the production of an anti- or counter-classical ugliness; finally the last, as we have already seen, to the destruction of all objects of civilisation.

With a few rare exceptions, French specialists have adhered — with academic care — to this triple classification. It has been authoritative throughout the entire world and, with it, the terminology used. It follows that behind the artificial structures of the horrible, one finds all the Scandinavian peoples.

Does one fully suspect that this terminology — apparently a simple statement of facts — promotes something other than a need for clarity? It permits the maintenance of the old obsession with the Goth, the Vandal and the Teuton...

It seems to us that the original purity of Gaul (that France before the Germanic invasions) has remained to this day, in France itself, an object of nostalgia.

In Scandinavia, a certain partial renunciation of our past and our opposition to pan-Germanist ideas have also contributed to the insidious spread of the regrettable state of mind denounced above.

Were we — we Scandinavians — to cease being publicly called into question by the terminology of this classification, were we to cease being thus accused and cited as the original source of barbarism, we would no doubt consent to remain silent. But since it seems to me that this should not cease, we must choose to speak and to make ourselves heard.

We must repeat that permanently denouncing the criminality of a criminal is to dangerously sensitise him to it. And, given our subject, it is to risk awakening terrible forces whose control would quickly become hypothetical, if not impossible.

History teaches us that in fact many of those who stigmatised the Barbarians and pilloried them practised Teutonism and Vandalism themselves. Moreover, they drew glory from it, and their art or their chronicles abundantly attest to this.

It is clear that the low level of consciousness that this boastfulness manifests precisely characterises barbarism. Indeed, the importance of the degree of consciousness has become the most commonly adopted criterion by which one differentiates the barbarian from the civilised.

Although imperfectly intelligible, the values of the civilised world appear prestigious to the less civilised. They are capable of provoking their admiration and of exerting an eminent influence.

Men — with a low degree of civilisation — thus find themselves engaged in a reflexive effort upon themselves. In doing so they will discover the intellectual and moral value of this act of reflection; and they will consider it fundamental. To judge thus is precisely to accede to a higher consciousness. It is soon to enjoy a critical faculty capable of being exercised at the expense of the very masters who taught it. To be able to denounce the limits of these masters and, the intoxication of discovery helping, to adopt intransigent principles of action against them. Finally, in the name of these principles, to desire and undertake purifying actions such as "the renewal of blood". This has been seen...


### TRUE AND FALSE COMPLEMENTARITY OF CULTURE AND CIVILISATION

Moreover, putting forward consciousness as a civilising authority is not without problems: to say that a man is transformed from barbarian into civilised by consciousness is to implicitly recognise that the unconscious and the subconscious are of a barbarous nature. Yet these are the substratum and the core of all human life. To it and to them is intimately linked this instinctive valorisation of man by himself: culture — not a sum of abstract knowledge but true culture, spontaneous and dynamic, in a word, living.

One sees therefore that grouping Civilisation and Consciousness obscures the relationship between Civilisation and Culture, and defamatorily darkens the latter.

How does Humanism, between Civilisation and Culture, confront the obstacles that barbarism places in its path? And how does it draw support from civilisation and from culture? This is what we must now ask ourselves.

Alexandre Mongait acquaints us with the official Russian position *(Archaeology in the U.S.S.R.)*: culture and civilisation are synonymous. A similar position among the Americans *(The Science of Culture,* Leslie A. White). And one encounters the same identification in France and in Italy.

Let us define civilisation as a framework and a structure of utilitarian characters.

In Scandinavian countries, Christianity, the Renaissance and Modern Development — civilising factors — have all equally played their role. Stages and levels of civilisation, they have been profoundly assimilated there. But currently they have ceased to occupy the role of civilising agents. They have become elements of culture.

Let us say it again: the same elements that long drew their significance from civilisation have henceforth become signs of culture.

*"The Sacred and the Profane", by Mircea Eliade, describes the* axis mundi *or* universalis columna *so richly spread throughout the graffiti of Normandy; sign of religious egocentrism, in the form of the image of space in three dimensions, normally represented by the column with the wheel or the crown. (See ill. no.* 126.) *One of the rare examples in Europe preserved in its primitive state is that of Alcubilla del Marqués in Spain. (See p. .)*

*The Christian cross establishes the antagonism between two contraries, a sign of the two flat dimensions of the surface.*

---

At the outset — a complex of more or less fortunate but always conscious decisions, civilisation now appears, in my native country, Denmark, as natural: a self-evident fact outside the field of consciousness. Civilisation has been transformed into culture.

What does this change of meaning signify? Does one lose in civilisation more than one gains in culture? Is there here degradation and destruction of an acquisition? Are we at last before a phenomenon that should be described as barbarous?

Just as one regards the existence of agriculture as prior to that of industry, and the existence of the countryside as prior to that of the city, some like to consider the existential priority of culture over civilisation: they are the Humanists.

For us, it suffices to have observed in Scandinavian countries the process of transformation described above, to affirm, on the contrary, that civilisation is prior to culture. Not to see it thus is, we believe, to surreptitiously substitute for the idea of a barbarism that would be on this side of culture, the idea of another that would be beyond it. One primary, the other decadent.

The acquisition of every new technique requires an apprenticeship — and what is called civilisation (at the limit, culture) is one.

An apprenticeship in the course of which faculties of attention and concentration prove necessary. It is impossible to be distracted or inattentive then.

The same is true for both culture and civilisation. With the sole difference between the two that Society places the emphasis on the latter. Society indeed imposes on us the permanent following of the transformation of the values of the civilised world — on pain of appearing asocial or of being accused of incivism. It refuses to situate civilisation and culture at different levels of human reality. Or else, if it consents to this, it wishes to believe it possible to occupy them at the same time: this is the bourgeois illusion.

Georges Dumézil underlines and makes explicit the tripartite character of Indo-European theology: Sovereignty-Force-Fecundity.

He has consulted all the documents — accounts and legends — that retrace the original life of the Nordic peoples, the Æsir and the Vanir. He has studied how, through wars and peace, the union between these two peoples was effected, and this in relation to the three principles mentioned above.

It suffices to compare the different images of universal genesis.*

But Georges Dumézil — no doubt a victim of his Latinity — commits, in our opinion, an error of judgement.

Placing, indeed, in one and the same group, the notions of force and fecundity, he individualises to excess the notion of sovereignty. He loses sight of the fact that the dialectical dynamic proper to action is based on the union of any two of these principles and, as its effect, the opposition of the group thus formed to the third principle.

In the present case, the union that was effected, between the Æsir — virile and warlike, but also — and much more fundamentally — priests (that is: spiritual community, superior principle of transcendence) and the Vanir (farmers, principle of fecundity) is the union of Sovereignty and Fecundity — a union that opposed itself to Force. There is not — as Dumézil tends to believe — Force and Sovereignty on one side and Fecundity on the other. There is no hierarchy: the three are on the same plane.

One finds the same error of judgement in Eastern European culture which opposes an abstract, cloistered and isolated Sovereignty to Fertility and Force.

Let us note that *among the Germanic peoples, Sovereignty and Fecundity are grouped in an ensemble that leaves apart, alone, available and tied to nothing, Force.*

That the diversity of European cultures (a diversity that developed above all from differences in conceptual representations) is to be deplored is possible. However, there is reason to exclude no element — and neither the Germanic peoples — from this variety that composes Europe. This is what Dumézil did, when instead of considering Force, Fecundity and Sovereignty on the same plane, he introduced — for the purpose of hierarchy — his scale of values.

Let us posit Force as a destructive energy.

According to whether one links its manifestations to Sovereignty or to Fecundity, it changes its nature. It will find an exoneration in Morality, a motive in Sociology.

It is Vandalism which, both in its philosophical reality and in its concrete existence, remains the heart of the problem.

It seems possible to us to envisage all *cultural* development as a progressive assimilation of usages. Thus initially, above all *scholastic:* experimentation and adaptation. Let us note, in passing, that from the early Middle Ages, the entire scholastic orientation is of Nordic inspiration.

The flourishing that the aforementioned development tends to bring about will only be complete if one refrains from denying the value of a capital inheritance: that of habits, ages, customs and traditions.

An act of false freedom — any denial, negation, of the latter inevitably has disastrous consequences. The Latin cultures, today detached from life, are the formidable warning of this.

Nordic ethics — and equally, the juridical principles that are, on the social plane, the translation and equivalent thereof — are founded at once on the freedom of trials, tests and experimentations and on the faculty of judgement. From the totality of these attempts and pragmatic conducts, conclusions and judgements are drawn. These, submitted to open discussion and to statistical criteria, make it possible to define an element of *norm.*

This is a parliamentarism that corresponds to the principles of the Thing.

To choose a particular element of norm in a way other than that stated above is to mathematically substitute the variable for the norm. It is to create chaos, to opt for a confused profusion; and it is furthermore to introduce the pathological into physiology.

But is this not what happens with Experimental Art?

*Experimental* Art, *Modern* Art? Can one truly doubt that there are here two different realities, opposable to each other? It is absolutely certain!

For each of them, fecundity is the golden rule. It is the law. As if it had become an absolute guarantee of value, and the surety of their reality.

Whence a multiplicity and prodigality of inventions; which — beyond the reach of the usual criteria — escape all judgement of value.

The result among the specialists of modern aesthetics, in the U.S.A., is neurosis-inducing and lasting headaches.

However, the will to grant absolute primacy to normalising methods — this option of the Nordic mentality — also has its weaknesses. This Nordic mentality makes itself — in a certain way — prisoner of its own will.

It renders itself incapable of valorising the unexpected, the new, the extraordinary. In these, it is obliged to see a direct attack on its sovereignty. For in it, let us recall, sovereignty is rigorously linked to the past, to fidelity to the past. Thus it is *incapable of deciding when "the never-before-seen" is of a disastrous nature, and when of a salutary nature.* All novelty appears pathological to it. Obviously, all artists whose own activity exceeds the rules suffer from this.

Georges Dumézil has justly remarked that there is hardly a theme of Scandinavian mythologies that was not taken up and continued by the Christian Middle Ages.

**THE DEVIL OUTWITTED**

Among other examples, he cites the theme of "The Devil Outwitted": the Devil's intervention in the construction of churches and the trick of which he, his work accomplished, is the victim. Thus the account of Gylfaginning: under the guise of a master craftsman, a giant proposed to the Æsir and undertook the construction of a castle — it being understood that this would be carried out in the span of one winter, with the help of his horse alone, and that the payment for his work would be, in addition to the sun and the moon, the beautiful Goddess Freyja — the ordinary object of the giants' covetousness.

The giant's horse having tirelessly brought, each night, the stones necessary for this construction, the Æsir decided — three days before summer — to deprive the craftsman of his payment; to this end they delegated their god Loki who took, by subterfuge, the form of a mare and diverted the horse from its labour.

In spite, the master craftsman let his anger burst forth — a giant's anger. The Æsir considered themselves, by this fact, freed from their engagement, called upon their god Thor who, with his hammer Mjöllnir, smashed the giant's skull and thus dispatched him to "Niflhel", "the mist-hell".


### ART AND CUSTOMS

Dumézil reproaches the Nordic archaeologists for classifying myths according to an excessively chronological method and order, but his classification — based on hierarchising value judgements — does not seem to me much more advantageous. For, in Scandinavian countries, the different myths are superimposed, in different colours certainly, but in an ensemble where the central themes reappear permanently.

One must know that the assimilation of the conquering Streitaxvölker peoples, "battle axe", is at the origin of the conflict between the Æsir and the Vanir, and, as a secondary consequence, the cessation, in Scandinavia, of all stone construction — this, until the Romanesque era, in the 11th century.

By creating a centralisation of savings, the material localisation of wealth in urban centres and especially in churches has broken, in our view, the original power of the farmers.

Products of art and civilisation, the objects enclosed in churches and in tombs were removed from the customary circuit of consumption. A problem was posed, agrarian in a certain sense, of the return to play of these values. The graffiti are the example of an attempt at resolution. They manifest and express an opposition to this systematised saving which was, in fact, a halt to production and consumption and an obstacle to civilisation.

Where and when should one protect the work of art, and against whom?

Civilising, social and political activity — in the form of the creation of States, the elaboration of laws, the construction of cities, was regarded with horror by the Scandinavian peasant-warriors, as the work of a giant — of a jætte. This affectivity prevented them from elaborating a civilisation in which the city would have played its role.

These jætter were poorly rewarded: having become Christians and Catholics, they erected a Church of builders whose power was so great that it could long forbid, whenever it saw fit, the entrance to Copenhagen to the very king of Denmark. But these jætter were finally completely excluded from Nordic social life.

One must know the harmful importance of the spirit of opposition to the union of the Æsir and the Vanir and know that their difficulties were caused above all by the spirit of the city and of civility.

The word "Vane" expresses all at once habit and habitation, cult and hearth (Ger.: Gewohnheit-Wohnung). It therefore designates an element of stability in two different forms: in Time through tradition and in Space through place. Everything that this word manifests of a will for permanence, conservation and maintenance is categorically opposed to "play", to the changing of customs, to fashion. This will for permanence and this concern for the stable — forged over centuries in the deepest recesses of the Nordic soul — cannot be changed.

Criticising Nordic art, Benedetto Croce assures (by an easy pastiche of Buffon's famous sentence: "The style is the man") that "the style is not the woman". False subtlety of a typically and fiercely Latin mind, which we do not see at all as truly calling Nordic art into question. Let us leave aside Socrates cited by P. M. Møller ("Only boys are interested in style, the adult man is no longer interested in it") and let us retain only that Croce's assertion tends to establish that Nordic expressionism is feminine because its spontaneity is a negation of style. Femininity and spontaneity: with Croce we are indeed in full Latinity! Fashion is indeed the woman, not the man.

Unconcerned with style, Nordic artists have created an Experimental Art that the Cobra formula illustrates quite well. To this art no less free than liberated is opposed Modern Art. A capital antagonism. Thus the title of the study inscribed in the programme of Palazzo Grassi, in Venice, by Paolo Marinotti seems to us to indicate — and in a central manner — where the heart of the problem in Art is situated today.

If one imagines furthermore that it was, originally, made not by the Danes, but by the Jomsvikings, we have the possibility of envisaging the solution to two enigmas: what is the origin of the strange round castles, serving at the same time as churches on the island of Bornholm, the former Burgundarholm, centre of the Jomsvikings, and subsequently the property of the cathedral of Lund, violently claimed by the king of Denmark? Then, the strange round castle, the so-called "Newport Mill" in the U.S.A. would be explained by the same activity, a hypothesis easy to have verified by specialists. At the time of the conquest of England, the Jomsvikings had already converted to Christianity; their protector was Saint Michael, or Saint George.*

### THE NORMAN GRAFFITI

How is one to decide the place occupied in the chronology of European development by the Norman graffiti? The analytical methods owed to Latin training seem to us to be of very good help in this regard. However, the problem remains whole since it is above all a matter of accounting for the signifying power of these graffiti and of explaining it. The difficulty persists of understanding how and why they appear to us as highly significant of a reality that concerns us most intimately.

To devote oneself to wanting to date these graffiti with great precision is, we believe, to disperse our forces, and above all to distract our attention from their high value of signification. Which obviously escapes all temporality. Let us not doubt that a valorisation of these graffiti, which would truly reflect their real importance, would be a critique — and in a compelling manner — of the traditional structuring of Art History. To bring these graffiti into Art History may perhaps be to add to the already great confusion in which it currently struggles. The risk is great but we must take it: it is the chance of a renewal.

The value of a Culture and its possibilities for progress depend essentially on the capacity to absorb new data and to integrate these elements into series of systematising structures. At once obstacles to its capacity for absorption and integration, and the limit of these, these elements tend to eliminate the systematising structure itself. Whence the importance of spontaneous reactions and over-radicalised tendencies engendered by these new elements. In this sense, the will for "ultra-modernity" of certain reactionaries goes beyond the real possibilities of evolution. No less dangerous appears to us the utopian optimism of certain progressives in whose eyes no frontier has any existence. And it is often in complete good faith that many of these, engaged in an antagonistic and contrary zone of culture, bring with the support of their progressivism a moral endorsement to the adversary himself.

Editions E. Einaudi — the most progressive among Italian publishers — have just published a remarkable work already considered a classic, by Gabriel Pepe: "Il Medio Evo Barbarico d'Italia".

With a naive partiality, the author expounds that Germanic and Latin cultures respectively originate from concepts: negative for the former, positive and ideal for the latter. Should we take seriously this elementary specification (in which an art critic like Pierre Restany also participates) and take offence at its casualness, there would hardly remain for us — we Scandinavians — anything but to destroy everything that among us bears witness to a free progress, or else to decide that no *mea culpa* falls upon us and, in a quite different state of mind, to deliberately go to war. A determination and initiative which the Scandinavians have until now refused, because they consider it the duty of every culture, society, man or nation to keep to itself its own antagonisms and to avoid projecting their troubling distortions upon anyone. If the Latins made the effort to arrive at a more precise consciousness of the limits or power of their principles and of their truths, all would benefit, and personally we would have the secret joy of having somewhat contributed to it: an immense pride... and no doubt more desire at heart to fruitfully deepen the real virtue of these principles and truths.

The book and Literature, vehicle and means of communication, transport and transmit stupidity as much as intelligence, ignominy as much as moral grandeur, falsehood as much as truth. Apart from any idea of value, they are the very use of human freedom.

Examined in a critical perspective concerned with encompassing and assimilating the overwhelming phenomena of our era (the fundamental problem of antagonisms raised by Lupasco), the positions taken by Pepe in "The History of the Barbarians in Italy", or again by Christopher Dawson and by Edouard Salin, seem to us not only inoperative, naive and doubtful, but moreover and above all outdated and of an obsolescence that does not even belong to the folklore of the mind or to the catalogue of its amusing finds.

No doubt, the probability that minds of different persuasions harbour a need for reciprocal understanding is slim. Slimmer still, the probability that such a current of understanding flourishes between them before they are overcome, towards one another, by blind hostility and pitiless intransigence. These probabilities that a rational and scrupulous examination reveals to be slight are however priceless for our hearts, they are one of the points where our irreducible hope wishes to defeat fate.

Although I do not think that Scandinavian methods are likely to arouse interest in France and to find a wide audience there, I have however chosen and decided to allow them to put forward their attempt at interpretation of the Norman graffiti.

Mr. K. E. Løgstrup, professor of philosophy at the University of Aarhus, writes in "Kunst og Etik": "Until now, the positions of philosophical problems have never in History been so distant, so completely indifferent to one another, as they are today between philosophy in the Anglo-Saxon world (Scandinavia included) and the philosophy of the continent."

This distressing state of affairs described by Professor Løgstrup has caused me a deep anxiety that has grown since the end of the war, and has so much distressed me that it was with true relief and real joy that I at last saw France refuse to commit itself to a united Europe and thus safeguard, for the good of all, the values proper to the "continent". It is evident that the great diversity of opinions between Nordic minds and Latin minds — especially French — is bound to superbly manifest itself and appear in a problem as singular as that of the Norman graffiti. These French positions on this problem are represented less substantially than I had wished. However, I believe that the attitude of Mr. de Bouard, of the University of Caen, given the great clarity of his exposition, will allow the reader to form an idea of the differences in perspective that the French and Nordic interpretations present between them. These complementary thoughts could assist each other on many questions, for a certain narcissistic and proud intoxication of Nordic philosophical thought balances marvellously certain sadly Cartesian wanderings of French philosophical thought. This is an additional example of the services that the idea of a willed and accepted complementarity can render.

---

In "L'Avant-garde Culturelle Parisienne depuis 1945" (Editions Guy Le Prat), Robert Estival doubts the interest of this notion of complementarity in well-formulated and apparently logical terms: "The feeling of sincerity, of love of the true, in art as in sciences, is introduced into the general dualism of human consciousness, subject-object, and applies itself to one or the other of these elements. For it seems that there is exclusivity at any given moment. It is either sincerity towards the Self or towards the Object, the Work. Everything even seems to happen as if sincerity for the one entailed a total or partial artificialisation, as the case may be, of the other."

Instead of trying to truly take sides within the very dualism that the above remarks bring out, we believe we should prefer another freedom: that of choice according to the opportunity offered by one or the other of these two positions. The event that we have to face being alone for us the force of law, we refuse to be the prisoner of any antagonism.

It would be exaggerated to claim that we have arrived excessively far in the interpretation of the signs reproduced in this work. One thing however is certain: contrary to what Glob thinks, these signs are not prior to the erection of the church stones on which they were engraved, the stones having been cut to fit their place.

Likewise, in most cases, it is out of the question that these graffiti are notes or sketches by labourers or builders, for they date from different periods and have been redrawn several times.

Our intention is to publish in a forthcoming volume the numerous drawings left by the builders of Norwegian wooden churches (the collection of these drawings has been assembled by Doctor Blindheim at the University Museum of Oslo). These builders' signs engraved on wood are very different from those left by the native Norman population. Only the Norwegian signs engraved by the native population, such as those of Nidaros at Trondhjem, present resemblances with their Norman counterparts.

Still regarding the origin of the Norman signs, we do not believe that the hypothesis according to which they were executed by people passing through, by Roma or by soldiers, should be retained.

In the end, we retain only the hypothesis according to which the natives are their sole authors. One may wonder about the purpose that their authors pursued. The study of the links that these signs present with local saints provides only a partial idea of this. The writings of P. Saintyves certainly constitute a fundamental piece of the dossier. Moreover, the ex-voto theory proves a very insufficient response to the problem. All examinations completed, we have a tendency to think that the motives of these engravers are of two kinds; indeed these signs seem to us to have two different orders of meaning: firstly, they are elements of conjuration, invocation, appeal, etc., which relate to exceptional events that do not concern daily life (natural scourges, for example); secondly, they recount the fabric of daily life and are intended to protect and enrich it and they concern only a regular and cyclical development. It is undeniable that this latter sort of magic refers characteristically to agrarian life.

After Olaus Magnus, I have tried to draw attention to the importance that the expression of agrarian life has had in my book: "The Golden Horns and the Wheel of Fortune" (more particularly in the chapter "The Rune Stick and the Work Calendar"). There is in the Latin countries a certain lack of interest in the agrarian revolution "the most profound that has ever affected humanity" ("Les civilisations néolithiques de la France" by G. Bailloud and Mieg de Boofzheim) and for concepts relating to art, a lack of interest that seems to us hardly compatible with a certain notion of the ideality of civilisation that is professed there. Of all the problems that the Norman graffiti raise, the most important can be formulated in this question: do these graffiti, as works-objects, have more importance than the acts that gave them birth? And if so, is their value the work of art in itself or the symbol? It seems that the superimposition of the images found allows one to exclude that they were made with the concern of making an art object in the classical sense of this notion.

Given the taste that Nordic minds have for polyvalent interpretations, we prefer to abstain from any attempt or endeavour to search for a more complex symbolism, an enterprise that would very likely be vain and hazardous. Well-known images, such as those in the form of "húsdrápa", give rise to innumerable interpretations as poetic as they are fanciful. In the form of "titoli", they unleash in Italy an avalanche of commentaries.

It remains therefore to explain, with regard to these graffiti, how they are related by the motives of their authors to what the Americans claimed to achieve with their "action painting": importance being given to the gesture and the execution.

This creation of graffiti, often due to a regular repetition of identical gestures, indicates that this is indeed a ritual.

Contrary to what happens in Scandinavia and in England where this ritual is of a religious nature (as attested by many images on the walls of religious buildings, and particularly one of them representing a Bishop in the act of engraving such a sign), the tradition of the Norman signs has been perpetuated in secrecy and it is pagan.

It is far from the case that the studies of Dr Blindheim and our own completely dispel the mystery of the Norman signs.

A more thorough study of these connections would require research both in Europe and in North Africa, and so we invite those who are interested in these questions to communicate to us all the information in their possession and equally to participate in our research.

The interpretations of Glob and Gjessing have aroused among the Latins an opposition which it is unfortunately difficult to think can be reduced. I am however pleased to have presented the texts of Glob and Gjessing — the irreducible hope that leads us to deny and to regard as null prognostications too learnedly and too rationally established often being right. So I have somewhat that same good conscience that Heine had when addressing the French: "I have only good intentions for you, and so I shall tell you bitter truths. You have more to fear from a liberated Germany than from the entire Holy Alliance, including the Croats and the Cossacks. First of all, they do not love you in Germany, which is almost incomprehensible, for you are very lovable... What exactly they reproach you for, I have never been able to discover. One day, in a tavern in Göttingen, a young Teutomaniac declared that the blood of the French must avenge the execution of Konradin von Hohenstaufen, whom you beheaded in Naples in 1268. You have certainly forgotten all this long since; but we forget nothing. You see that when we feel like settling scores with you, we shall not lack good reasons."

The Scandinavians, unlike the Germans, have no scores to settle with French reality; so it presents itself to them in another way. Precisely, our love of France and of the French feeds, enriches and blossoms on qualities profoundly different from our own, and your faults, also differing, are counted as nothing against you. So that for a Scandinavian, to be in Paris is to live with a certain feeling of liberation, it is to no longer feel the weight of our traditional chains. To those who dream of a new Europe built in the image of the Holy Roman Empire, we must recall another European version whose importance History has confirmed: medieval Europe.

It is certain that the future of Europe is inscribed in a greater communication of minds, and that the mere material conquest of these means is insufficient. Mutual ignorance is no longer even a crime: merely an error. The false personalisation of responsibilities ultimately engages the responsibility of each of us on grounds of anonymity.

French criticism quickly reaches its limits; it is constantly thrown back to its weakness by its incapacity to exceed the narrow frame of the present — an almost instantaneous criticism, without memory. On the contrary, the Nordic spirit never proceeds to any critical examination without going very far back into the past to seek elements of information there; and so criticism is, in the North, very heavy with consequences: a veritable indictment.

French criticism always voluntarily finds its limits, Nordic criticism never. We think today that there would be great advantage in harmonising these various critical methods with one another and in growing accustomed to their simultaneous use.

### PRODUCTION, CONSUMPTION, ADMINISTRATION

*To consume is to produce oneself.*

The most important among the antagonisms proper to economic structures seems to appear with regard to the problem of causality in the relations between production and consumption: Does one create in order to consume or does one consume in order to create? Which of these two activities is a function of the other? And once this mystery is clarified, will one know any better the authority that hides behind administrative power, and furthermore to whom it is answerable?

We have already indicated that the events of economic reality are ordered in very different series according to the zones of European culture (three in number) in which these events occur.

For Nordic minds, the very importance of the link they establish between past and present distracts them from any event or manifestation that is pure actuality. Were they, by exception, to concentrate their attention on such an event, they could not help but draw towards this event everything that seems to them to participate in it from the past — it being understood that the most distant past will also be summoned to furnish information.

By tradition one sees destruction and death, the end, as a passage towards the past. The difficulty contained in this attitude is that one cannot affirm that every complete process, in whatever domain, always presents itself as a destruction of given conditions. Moreover, there can be destruction without profit for higher creativity. The right to destruction is thus the sign of superiority. In refusing the peoples of the great migration the justification for their destructions, one remains attached to the old hierarchical structure of the Roman empire, a system already in full collapse.


#### DESTRUCTION - CONSUMPTION

*Seen from the outside, every consumption presents itself under the aspect of a destruction.*

In the contemporary economy, the instability of the production-consumption equilibrium is only apparent. This is a false notion that at once masks the importance and volume of production and consumption.

In reality, the considerable increase in the means of the former on the one hand, and in the needs of the latter on the other, tends to create, between the two, an absolute correspondence and equivalence.

We are heading towards the perfect.

Among the data from which production "thinks its products" is found the conviction that consumption is essentially of a destructive nature. No creation of objects is undertaken without the addition of elements that will hasten their consumption. Factors of destruction, they accelerate their disappearance.

Henceforth the life of the manufactured product is from the outset, deliberately, shortened. It is no longer durable but ephemeral. Its consumption is no longer deferred but immediate. The solid and the stable have ceased to be desired and the Americans have even created an expression that designates these products guaranteed without durability.

In view of this situation, it seems to us that vandalism is simply a consumption like any other.

In parallel, certain economists consider war and the war economy as a gigantic consumption. Essayists and philosophers assure us that production necessarily gives rise, sooner or later, to a war economy.

#### SITUGRAPHIC APPLICATION IN EUROPE.

Only triolectic analysis can dispel the confusion created by effects ignored until now. Hence the importance of the means for detecting fundamental complementarities. How to detect them? We shall consider as irrefutable proof of the existence of the complementarity of two cultures the fact that in one of them the Reaction uses — with the intention of hindering progress — the progressive ideas of the other. Of such a situation we are today, in Europe, the witnesses. One need only look north, south, east.

Geographically, the geometric location of the capitals of the Latin countries reflects a median, symmetrical and central composition. All roads lead to Rome. Or to Paris. Or to Brasilia.

Stockholm, Oslo, Copenhagen, London, New York: so many frontier-cities genuinely turned towards the unknown, and open to the foreign.

Like pre-war Vienna, Berlin bore the traces of the character of the old Romano-Christian Empire invented by Charlemagne. It has been a constant of post-war American policy to exploit in Berlin its character as a frontier-city. The understanding with Russia will obviously shift this game towards Jerusalem — frontier-city of the "Christian nation". The conflict between Abelard and Bernard is once more topical, but this time, the answers are known in advance. The fascination is gone, except for fools.

At the base of every system, or social organisation, one always finds three complementary elements: production, administration and consumption. The Latin, Germanic and Russo-Byzantine systems are differentiated by their modes of application of these elements. The Latin system seems to us characterised: firstly, by the virtualisation of administration and secondly, by the actualisation of the variable production-consumption unity; the Germanic by the virtualisation of consumption on the one hand, and on the other, by the actualisation of a fusion between production and administration. Finally the Russo-Byzantine system based on a virtualisation of production and the actualised fusion of administration-consumption.

We have previously noted the existence of a parallelism that links consumption to destruction. Among the Germanic peoples — and among them alone — the will for purity permeates and animates the act of consuming to such a degree that it makes their system of consumption a unique system. On the other hand, the Latin principles of consumption permit, authorise and favour a freedom of play, and this without further restricting in production this same freedom of play. But in the Latin framework, the freedom of consumption — or of destruction — never becomes total and always remains on this side of the "barbaric point" of the Nordics.

These different systems which are responsible for different "creations of situations" have led the Situationist movement to recognise and admit the diversity of these methods. It is because this movement consented to critically examine the different natures of these methods that it was able to maintain its homogeneity. In the first years after the war, opposition to the classical concept of art manifested itself in two ways: some declared themselves in favour of the creation of a new kind of art that would have represented a dimension opposed to classical art; others decided still more radically to deny in every domain the value of art through an anti-artistic attitude. In Latin culture, the opposition to art and its sidelining has certainly never been total — this opposition being above all rhetorical. But it must be emphasised that this opposition based on rhetoric, and which therefore excludes all personally lived attitude and all sincerity, is of a terribly more radical nature than all other oppositions. Thus in Paris, the modern tendency could be seen bringing about a situation that tends towards a complete void — this with the avowed intention of removing all possible freedom and fulfilment from Art, and with the secret project of transforming the latter into a means, into an instrument. This crisis of art that we are living through today finds its most extreme illustration in the conflict of the S.I. This movement, profoundly representative of the Nordic existential attitude on the artistic plane, would gain in originality and authority if the thoughts of the different minds who, in various capacities — philosophers, poets or thinkers — belong to existentialism were better known, and if the public better understood how these different thoughts are articulated between them. Thus, behind Kierkegaard there hides a Poul Martin Møller, somewhat as one finds the genius of Socrates behind the system of Plato. Let us say in passing that there is no reason to believe that Socrates — originally a sculptor — would have consented to this exclusion of the liberal arts subsequently professed by Plato. Sartre committed the gross error of considering Kierkegaard's scholastic system as a humanism. Shortly before his death, Poul Martin Møller wrote a poem entitled "The Artist among the Rebels". This poem tells how, in 1830, in Paris, a group of rebels broke into an artist's studio with the aim of destroying his work and how the attacked artist reacted vigorously with a violent counter-attack. I must have been profoundly impressed by this poem which caused its author to be classified as "politically reactionary". A poem remarkable for its great beauty, it is equally remarkable for its political character: half a century after the imaginary confrontation that is its subject, a similar conflict, but real this time, broke out within the Paris Commune. Prophetically again, this poem seems to have brought to light contradictions that today have become the internal contradictions of the S.I. due to the questioning of the unity of this movement by Debord, and all his partisans. The anecdote of the arsonists who came to destroy Notre-Dame, in the last days of the Commune and who encountered there a battalion of armed artists, "constitutes a good example of direct democracy" and allows us to clearly grasp, on a precise point, the ambivalence of all *a priori* conservative protection: against these men who wanted to accede to expression by translating through a destructive demonstration their total defiance of a society of oppressors, was the unanimous body of artists right to defend Notre-Dame in the name of permanent aesthetic values? And finally, in the name of the spirit of Museums?

Politically partisans of the Commune, "these artists acting as specialists found themselves in conflict with an extremist manifestation of the struggle against alienation." (Debord). *Into the dustbin of history.*

What happens when at the conclusion of a combat one of the protagonists disappears? And particularly when there is annihilated that one of the three elements which alone faced a group of two others? Between the two parties whose union against the common adversary previously formed an actualised antagonism, a schism immediately occurs. Depolarisation polarises the former allies. A struggle begins for the possession of the now available goods of the vanished party. The appropriation of these goods will trigger in their future possessor a process of identification with the former adversary; that is, a new union which represents a possibility of actualisation. Every war and every state of combat aims to annihilate an adversary who is at bottom less real than virtualised; so that the disappearance of this adversary actualises in a way his reality, to the point that at the end of a combat, one sometimes has the paradoxical impression that it is the loser who is the victor. It is obviously clear that without the will of each of the two surviving protagonists to become the proprietor of the goods of the vanished party, no combat would take place between them.

It is certain that Debord reveals his mentality and his politico-Latin formation by considering artists as pure specialists and finally, as simple instrumental means.* History shows that artists have constantly struggled against the apriorism of this identification; their participation in all the great revolutionary currents bears witness to this, and this utilitarian attitude towards art has always been

*It is true that he is against this specialisation. But does he not too quickly make it, precisely, an obligatory characteristic of all art, in order to thus totally liquidate the problem of art?

considered by them as a form of oppression and an attack on their freedom. This oppression was adopted, officialised and legalised in 787 by the Council of Nicaea.

In approving the action of the arsonists against the armed artists (1), Debord has slipped into the trap that Estivals had prepared. For years, the latter has not tired of repeating that the affinity that binds us, Debord and me, is "a pure practical trick without a foundation of common ideas". Unfortunately, Debord, through the assent he gives to incendiary vandalism, in this precise case where a socialism and a barbarism are opposed, finds himself indeed on the side of the barbarians. For — let us ask ourselves — by what means did those artists envisage destroying the arsonists? Quite simply by recourse to Teutonic acts...

To want to judge, in a society where military reality is all-powerful, the greater or lesser degree of barbarism of conducts and behaviours, is a vain project doomed to failure. The acceptance of vandalism entails, ipso facto, consent to Teutonism. That Debord — committed as he now is — could return to the conventional and agreed-upon positions which are, in fact, those of the Parisian avant-garde, does not seem to us either desirable or possible.

The concept of situation — this all-purpose concept of existentialist thought, this false sesame of a surpassed and bastard philosophy — has not led J.-P. Sartre very far. The vitality of Situationism makes this Franco-German existentialism, which rests comfortably on a set of old propositions — precisely on the Danish existentialism of the last century — appear moribund. Unconcerned therefore with surpassing, this French offshoot of existentialism has not imprisoned Debord. However, one becomes the amused witnesses of this paradoxical spectacle: on one side Sartre, who first concerned himself with writing for generations to come, has been gradually driven to the contemporary and drowned in an overabundant actuality; on the other side Debord, interested only in actuality, finds himself condemned to building a distant future, and this in view of a posthumous glory that, in fact, leaves him indifferent...

The Latin spirit and character accommodate themselves easily — naturally — to the existentialist "living the present". The pure instant is for them an evident banality, an immediate reality, whereas for Nordic thought and temperament — let us say for Kierkegaard — the pure instant is a mad dream and a vain hope.

The fear that Cobra's activity might lead to a unilateral Nordicism made me seek the collaboration of a man whom I thought could be the ideal successor to André Breton as a fertile promoter of new ideas. I have named Debord, and nothing since has made me change my mind about him.


#### STATE — FAMILY — NATION

In his study on the origin of the family, Friedrich Engels deepens Marxist thought on the factors of human progress. This "progress" appears to him to pass through three phases: the savage stage — which is that of pure consumption and corresponds to the non-productivity of hunters; the barbaric stage — characterised by a production turned towards consumption; the civilised stage — which, producing in order to produce, outside of all consumption, is linked to the appearance of slavery. The slave was a producer to whom all right to consumption was refused. In insidious and latent forms, Western society has created a subjection and an enslavement that are not foreign to the ancient slavery.

All the false judgements, errors and chimerical ideas that concern the notion of progress are mercilessly brought to light by the triolectic system. One cannot create a valid opposition to barbarism without seeing in savagery and in slavery one and the same thing — which is, at bottom, civilisation. Civilisation is the savagery that the moral obligation to maintain slavery justifies. Material consequence and social reality: a production that gives rise to no consumption. To isolate the producer, to free the slave: this is what it is to truly face Barbarism, Savagery. This is the programme and the goals of Socialism — a tendency that manifests the design of "making peace" with the Savage, in order to recover for itself the force that animates him — in the form of destructive power. Socialism thus returns, without glory, to the old opposition between civilisation and barbarism. It strives to bring production and administration closer together and refuses to see that this alliance is nothing more than a new antagonism. An inexorable process that creates hell for everyone, and from which only the Situationist International finds itself disengaged.

We now know that — as an expression of the will for social progress — every revolution engenders a higher social life but introduces into this same life a greater uniformity, under the colour of stability, and mercilessly restricts the freedom of each. The Situationist tendency must aim to reconquer the rights to free human play, a play that "Entfremdung" (alienation) ceaselessly tends to reduce.

The graffiti — whether Norman, Parisian or other — are testimonies to this will for presence, and to an opposition to sacrosanct technique. A tendency such as the Situationist movement risks appearing counter-revolutionary. In reality, such a tendency makes it possible to clearly see the error committed by the engineer Sorel, who studied the revolutionary movements of our century as a function of his system of the clean slate. At the beginning of the last century, Poul Martin Møller had already foreseen the possibility of error entailed by the following apophthegm: a revolutionary movement has value only at the stage preceding its practical realisation. A formulation that can be made otherwise, and give rise to images that borrow from a mechanistic reality. Thus, one may understand that it is exclusively during a fall that energies are released, at once new and available; that after the fall there follows a new stage in which the energies become more blocked than they were previously. Thus even the triolectic system is at once a springboard and a brake: it releases energies, then blocks them. Poul Martin Møller gave an account of this in advance: "A new idea has value only during its penetration into the mass. Once generally accepted, it loses its value." It is therefore evident that from the day when the symbolic oppositions that geographically divide Europe into North and South disappear, the exceptional sources of an admirable energy will also disappear at the same time.

It is not only a duty, it is a right to demand that this energy not be wasted in vain combats, but that it serve on the contrary for a general enrichment.

Among all the Histories of the Germanic peoples, that of Friedrich Engels seems to me to be the most intelligent and the most impartial.

To the question: "What then was the mysterious spell by which the Germanic peoples breathed a new vital force into dying Europe?", he gives an excellent answer, without however completely explaining why the simple appearance of a barbarism within a civilisation sufficed to create new sociological bases — superior and forever irreducible.

Engels tells us that: "The Germanic peoples were barbarians, in that they did not succeed in establishing a total slavery like the labour slavery of Antiquity and the domestic slavery of the Orient." In the depths of the psyche, rights and duties are not differentiated from one another. The notion of property, "fruit of personal labour" in question here, is therefore no longer valid there.

Engels continues: "Civilisation engenders a class that no longer occupies itself with production (nor with consumption), but only with the exchange of products: the merchants." Engels does not seem to perceive that once freed from the merchant class in which it was born, this activity forged the structures of the State. It is therefore with levity that Engels affirms: "The gentile organisation ceased to exist and was replaced by the State" and "the State falls inevitably with the division of society into classes, relegated to the museum of antiquities, alongside the spinning wheel and the bronze axe". It is to be thought that the spinning wheel and the axe will in that case always remain indispensable instruments.

"The conjugal union is the cell-form of civilised society. It marks a great historical progress; however with it begins an epoch in which every progress is also — at the same time — a relative step backward." Engels is speaking to us there of an epoch in which physicists discovered the law of the constancy of energy. A law that carries no weight in the socialist world for in the eyes of the Marxists — and of Lassalle —: "United force is greater than the sum of forces united." We are in the realm of the miraculous...

Engels wondered how it could have come about that the Roman family, of a more primitive organisation than that of the gens (people-family), had marked a progress in relation to the latter. And likewise the barbaric gens of the Germanic peoples in relation to the Roman family. It seems that the profound reasons for this evolutionary dynamism escaped Engels.

The barbaric gens was by no means effaced. It was even so little effaced that its original vigour gradually became, over the centuries, a veritable power; so that in our days it alone proves itself opposable to the concept of State. It is no longer called the gens but the nation.

The identification of the past with the present, of origin with reality, of birth with contemporaneity, gives life to the reputedly noble notion of nation. If, while rightly considering the important Germanic contribution to the building of medieval Europe, one nevertheless denies it any role in modern culture, one will expose oneself to understanding nothing at all of the European becoming. This becoming will remain obscure.

It is through the Arian church that the Europe of the gens became the Europe of nations. The considerable role played by this church in European evolution would appear to us even more essential if we were given to possess all the information that a long voluntary obscurantism withholds from us. The transformation of the gens into a nation was greatly facilitated — if not entirely achieved — by the theologians who introduced into the ceremony of baptism a ritual whose high signifying power was a salutary shock for consciences. The ceremony of Christian baptism symbolically determined a new epoch: the dawn of a rebirth.

One understands the importance that this ceremony had in Scandinavia: and this even before the advent of Christianity, and one also understands why, even today, Scandinavians manifest a manic interest in medieval baptismal fonts. One would not easily explain the participation of the Nordic peoples in the Crusades if one refused them all feeling of religious belonging to the Christian nation.

France was the only European country not to be duped by the national character of Christian expansion. In "The Birth of the Middle Ages", L. B. Moss gives the reasons: "In Gaul, Clovis set the seal on his work by organising a national church that made it possible to combine the political advantages of Arianism and those of Catholicism." The symmetry of the roles played by the State and the Nation was, later, to push the French to become the standard-bearers of the idea of nationalism and then, — without stumbling unduly over chauvinism — to enrich the world with a notion whose effects have not yet ceased to be felt: the notion of internationalism.

It is thus that, defenceless against the Catholic "church-state", the Christian nationalism of the Germanic peoples found itself subjected to a theocratic pressure exerted upon it by this formidable "church-state" incapable moreover of assuming the secular responsibilities of a theocracy. This theocratic pressure threw into the fire the last Nordic hopes, which disappeared in the smoke of the pyres where the Templars perished. It is to France that the pitiful glory fell but the nation-state was created. In this new State, room for the family and its chief-majordomus whom we would unfortunately come to know under the name of chancellor.

The woman who, in the North, looked after the house and had the management of it, would see her importance increase enormously through this expansion of the family. We know the effects of this through the history of the Middle Ages: playing the church against the men, she later became its prisoner herself. Things happened differently in Byzantium and it was the State that prevailed. The Soviet Republics are national and united in an all-powerful State. At least this is the Russia of Stalin, that of his book on nationalities.

It is more than interesting — it is impressive — to compare with the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics the genesis of a nation such as the United States, where the national idea takes an expansive, supra-state form.

It is necessary to form an idea of the nature of the complementarity existing between French internationalism, American nationalism and Russian statism, if one does not wish to become the victim of chimeras and illusions as to the possibilities of a general understanding.


#### THING — POLIS — SOVIET

The modern State has differentiated powers under three forms: legislative, juridical and executive power. It is through the union of two of these powers — the principle of antagonisms tells us — that the modern State acquires vitality and dynamism.

Among the Latins, the virtualisation is that of judgement while it is that of execution among the Nordics. I believe it necessary to insist on this: among the former, the fusion takes place between legislation and judgement, while it takes place between legislation and execution among the latter. As it is understood that legislative activity is political, the dynamism of the Polis is here concretised. In the Nordic Thing, execution is unconditional and it is judgement that takes on a political character. One sees therefore that the principle of the Thing, far from being as is often claimed (and especially in Germany) a "rudimentary Polis", possesses its own dynamism, one that is complementary to that of the Polis.

Better juridical foundations for political power have brought to the application of the Thing principle in the U.S.A. a purity that it does not have in Scandinavia. The execution of the man presumed to be the murderer of President Kennedy reveals occult political manoeuvres that are an attack on the very system of government that the United States gave itself once the civil war was over. Will the gravity of this act ever find its sanction?

The hesitations of those who are the descendants of the former Northerners to juridically seize this affair proves to us the existence of a passionate complex of tendencies. This situation seems to us to present a strange and significant similarity with one of the episodes of the struggle of the Germanic peoples against the Romans — the one that Engels reports —: the manoeuvre used by Arminius to defeat Varus and thus put a definitive end to Roman projects of colonising the Germanic countries. It was by finding themselves confronted with acts, principles and methods that were radically foreign to them that the Romans became aware of their impotence and renounced their enterprise. In both cases, through violence and brutality, it is the same defeat of civilised values.

During the war there was, in Holland, a man who was so disgusted by the intensity of Danish and Norwegian curiosity about the invaders that he preferred to commit suicide. Had this man of honour known the story of Arminius, he would perhaps have been less shocked that no one turned his back on the invader and he would no doubt have foreseen that this attitude would make the Scandinavian resistance the most effective of European organisations.

Arminius remained at the side of Varus as if he were his friend, while at the same time he organised and set up the enormous enterprise that was to crush the Roman army. Had he wished, he could even have driven the Romans from Gaul, but he was not a conqueror. It was William the Bastard who revealed this possibility.

From that time dates the tenacious and irreducible distrust of the Romans towards the Germanic peoples.

It seems, in these circumstances, that the Germanic peoples adhered to the precept: "One need only be honest with honest people", the rule of the Thing. Regarding the manner in which the Romans judged this event, Engels tells us "that one thinks one is reading French writers of the best chauvinist period, who pour out the cup of their anger over the perjury of York and the treachery of the Saxons at Leipzig. The Germanic peoples had sufficiently learned what fidelity to treaties and the loyalty of the Romans were, when Caesar attacked the Usipetes and the Tencteri by surprise during the negotiations and in full armistice; they had learned what they were when Augustus had the legates of the Sicambri imprisoned, before whose arrival he refused all negotiation with the Germanic tribes. All conquering peoples have this in common that they dupe their adversary in every possible way and find this entirely proper; but as soon as the adversaries allow themselves the same thing, they cry perjury and treachery. Now the means used to reduce to subjection must be equally licit for throwing off the yoke."

This last consideration of Engels is of indubitable correctness. We must however remark that the Germanic peoples applied themselves to refining and making remarkably operative two techniques proper to them: those of the disorganisation of action and that of the organisation of protest action. In the latter they have acquired such a degree of efficiency that they have been called — not without reason — the Protestants.

One must know the importance that the Thing principle has taken on in American life and how much it permeates the spirit of the laws of this country. An obligation such as that imposed on every citizen appearing before judges to tell "the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth" is significant in this regard. We see the honest man of the Thing appear. On the contrary, dishonoured and excluded is he who refuses information and conceals it. Whether or not this information has a character of intimacy does not exempt one from the obligation of absolute sincerity.

This practice is difficult to reconcile with the ideal of the Polis. An ideal whose rhetoric on the contrary imposes "to say everything except the truth" and which is illustrated, among other stories, by that of the young Spartan who, his intestines torn by a fox, prefers to die rather than confess to being the author of a theft. Both methods each have their advantages. But the American will to use them jointly leads to disastrous impasses.

In Northern Europe, it was always through vague and imprecise confessions that the recognition of facts was practised. If these were very detailed, the account became ambiguous, obscure and nebulous to the point that no one understood anything anymore. This was the beginning of an anti-rhetoric which, later, permeated a certain literature. A literature exasperating for a purist with an eminently critical mind like Anatole France, who saw in it a defiance of that famous clarity that the French prize so highly.

The Germanic spirit therefore appeared prone to dissimulation, hypocrisy and lying. Strabo describes the Germanic peoples as "shrewd, a people made for lying", and the Roman Velleius speaks thus of the Celts: "Simple and without malice, they rush into combat before the eyes of all and without prudence, so that their adversaries have an easy victory."

But the critical sense, the taste for precision and the concern for exactitude often bring the French to a need for truth and to an intoxication that, at the limit, has the name: cynicism. Frankness — etymologically "the Franks" — also presents odious certainties.

France is nevertheless the worthy successor of that ardent Gaul. It has in its favour a taste for political justice that makes it the best guarantor in the world of equality and truth.

Of the different contributions of the provinces to French vitality, the Norman factor has not been one of the least.

And on the plane of art, the Norman graffiti contribute not a little to illuminating the meaning of the image, the sign and writing.

The appearance of the Soviets, or popular councils, was not foreseen in the Russian revolution, and yet it was its driving force. Lenin did not see here the old tradition of Slavic culture resurging. He believed them to be a creative miracle of the people. Polis, Thing and Soviet, here are three complementary, irreducible and fundamental structurations in European development. Like Aron, the psychologist C. G. Jung bases himself on the spiritual structuration of the Polis to explain the unconscious; Adler chooses that of the Thing, and Freud that of the Soviet, without these structurations being of a "political" order. The illusion of a synthesis here on the classical basis, even modernised, is excluded. A new method is needed. Can the triolectic be this method? We shall see.

## IMAGE ANALYSIS BY GUTORM GJESSING

Fig. 1

Here only some crosses are carved in, in addition to a good number of cup-marks. The figures at the top of the image also depict crosses on a triangular base. They are all simple Latin crosses.

Fig. 2

Here too there seem to be only crosses and cup-marks depicted. At the bottom of the pedestal beneath the weathered carvings is a cardinal cross and apparently a papal cross (with two and three arms respectively), in addition to a Latin cross. At the very top of the image there is a cross with two oblique strokes up towards the crossbar, possibly a strong schematisation of the crucified figure.

Fig. 3

At the top left, some Gothic minuscules. Otherwise the wall is strewn with large and small cup-shaped hollows, crosses, etc. Of interest are some of the hollows in the upper part of the image, because they form the centre of a radiant crown, and are obviously intended as suns or stars. The figures cannot be dated, apart from the minuscules which are probably from the 1200s or 1300s.

Fig. 4

At the top right is a Latin cross, otherwise here there are mainly hollows, partly placed in straight lines, partly apparently at random. But at the top of the image, somewhat to the left, they are placed in a circle with a hollow as the centre, as discussed in the introduction. It also appears that figures were carved in earlier than the time the hollows were made. These figures can no longer be identified.

Fig. 5

The greatest interest here centres on the five cup-marks just below the centre of the image. They are arranged in the form of a cross. A couple of other cup-shaped hollows can also be seen. At the top of the image one sees a cross where the arms are terminated with short cross-strokes.

Fig. 6

Here the cup-shaped hollows are placed on a horizontal plane and could therefore in themselves be conceived as bowls in which something has been offered, as the cup-shaped hollows on the rock carvings from the late Stone Age and the Bronze Age have been interpreted by some researchers.

Fig. 7

Here again there are only cup-marks. At the top a quantity of them are arranged in an approximately circular figure which can, as it were, be compared with the well-known sun image from Bohuslän, where the spaces between the spokes are densely filled with cup-marks (Almgren fig. 140). Below are two crosses on a base formed by cup-shaped hollows, which may strengthen an interpretation of the upper figure as a sun image.

Fig. 8

Here too only cup-shaped hollows are depicted. That is to say, beside the hollows there are, at the top in the right corner, a couple of nearly parallel lines that cannot now be identified.

Fig. 9

The main motif is still cup-shaped hollows, placed partly in more or less horizontal rows, among others two long parallel rows. Of greater interest is a hollow that forms the centre of a larger sun figure consisting of two concentric circles with closely placed radial rays from the centre out to the outer double circle.

Fig. 10

Depicts a peculiar serpent figure immediately beneath a human face where eyes, nose and mouth are formed by cup-marks. It is possible that the head is in reality the head of the serpent. Some other cup-shaped hollows are also present. The serpent has played an important role in Nordic folk belief. It is both a death symbol and a fertility symbol. In the introduction it is mentioned that it can be equated with the plough as a spring symbol; according to Ole Worm (1643) because in spring it used to leave the den and come out into the sunshine. But the serpent's connection with fertility concepts also seems to be due to its resemblance to the male sexual organ. At the Arrephoria festival in Athens which was dedicated to Demeter and Kore, pastries in the form of serpents and phalloi were thrown into a cleft, and serpent and phallus were used alternately as a symbol for guardian spirits.

Fig. 11

A quantity of loosely scratched lines and complete figures, among them a couple, roughly square with radial lines (diagonals and perpendiculars from the sides). More or less corresponding figures are not uncommon in these church carvings (fig. 140-149, 155-157, 165), but obviously have no direct connection with ecclesiastical symbolism. A number of them undoubtedly represent game boards. There is no doubt that a figure like fig. 148 depicts a "mill board" (nine men's morris). The same is probably true of others, e.g. fig. 155-156. The mill game is evidently ancient in Europe. In the North it has been known at the latest since the Viking Age. I myself once reconstructed in drawing a beautiful mill board from the finds in the Gokstad ship. In a couple of places mill boards are placed in close connection with a church (fig. 155-156).

Fig. 12

The main figure here appears to be a strongly schematised female figure. Of the face, the nose is possibly marked, perhaps also the eyes, and the breasts are apparently suggested. The figure is made with a double contour, an inner deep one, and an outer one that is only loosely scratched in. To the left of it are a good number of cup-shaped hollows, placed apparently without any system. In addition a large Latin F. Above the head of the female figure is a now illegible inscription in cursive capitals as well as an angle with its apex pointing up and a cross inside, also loosely scratched in.

Fig. 13

Hollows arranged as three circular figures with a vertical line downwards, which is crossed by a horizontal line on each. Schematised sun symbols or human figures?

Fig. 14

Here only cup-shaped hollows can be seen.

Fig. 15

Here too only cup-shaped hollows are depicted, but arranged in a circle with a hollow at the centre. One can here compare with rock carvings, where the hollows often have a direct connection with sun symbols, as mentioned in the introduction.

Fig. 16

The most prominent feature of this image is the peculiar, deeply carved circles with cup-shaped hollows at the centre (cf. fig. 22). One of them is surrounded by a more deeply carved square. Otherwise one sees crosses with hollows as the termination of the cross-arms, a feature that has been common, at least in the Nordic Middle Ages, where among other things stonemason's marks often have strongly punctuated line endings. One of the crosses (top centre) has been carved over older figures, but these can no longer be identified. Otherwise here too are some cup-shaped hollows, as well as a figure that cannot be interpreted. It consists of a horizontal rectangle with a long line downwards from one of the short sides.

Fig. 17

Sun wheel formed as a cross inscribed in a circle, completely of the same type as the most common form of sun wheel in the rock carvings.

Fig. 18

Four sun figures all apparently carved at the same time. A compass was not used, but all have a fairly deep hollow at the centre, and the radii are irregularly placed. To the right of the sun figure furthest to the right, a date has been carved of which only the first digits 180 are included in the image. The numbers are carved deeper than the circle, but the approximately rectangular framing is carved with lines that have exactly the same character as the sun figures. It is therefore probable that all four sun figures were made at the beginning of the 1800s. Immediately above the date is an inscription of four to five letters, but it cannot be deciphered from the photograph.

Fig. 19

Three sun figures, a large one in the middle with a smaller one on each side. After the large sun figure was carved, a new circle was carved in, but the radii of the large one confused the stone carver so that he could not manage "his own" radii. The smaller sun figure to the left is, on the other hand, quite clear. The vertical radii — which, like the radii in general, were carved later than the circles — are extended downwards to what may be a kind of base. But here too are a couple of older lines that cannot be deciphered. Here too no compass was used.

Fig. 20

The entire figure consists of a large sun wheel, executed freehand, consisting of two concentric circles with a cup-mark at the centre and with radii that run continuously from the centre to the outer circle. From the intersections of the lines one can see that the radii were carved in last. For comparison, a rock carving from Stora Backa, Brastad parish, Bohuslän, may be mentioned, where there are several sun images depicted in apparently ritual situations, and where they consist of wheels with an outer and an inner circle (Almgren fig. 1). The same applies to a rock carving from the nearby Backa (Almgren fig. 103), where the sun image is placed on a high stand. The same design is also known from other places, such as Skåne (Bing fig. 34) or Østfold (Gjessing pl. IX:3) etc.

Fig. 21

The figure consists of a large sun symbol, formed as a simple wheel with 12 spokes and the centre marked by a deep, strongly marked hollow. The sun wheel is executed freehand.

Fig. 22

The image depicts ten unusually deeply carved circles each with a large, deep cup-shaped hollow at the centre. The figures are carved so deeply that they stand out in bas-relief. The nearest parallel I know to these is a stone from Marienborg Park, Kr. Haldensleben, Saxony, "which is covered with a great number of artificial cup-marks, some of them surrounded by rings" (Schultz Ø 1939).

Fig. 23

A quantity of figures, mainly dot-circles, executed with a compass, at least eight. The vast majority have exactly the same radius, and must therefore be contemporary. These appear to have been carved (cut?) over other figures that now for the most part cannot be interpreted. The circle at the top right is thus made over a figure where some of the lines have been reused, so that the circle has become a sun cross with extended arms. The vertical arm thus cuts through the circle below. These lines are in turn obviously connected to a curved line roughly parallel to part of the circle. The lower block to the left has a dot-circle and right beside it is a coarsely carved cross figure, as well as some apparently quite random lines. To the right of the circle are five cup-shaped hollows arranged in a group. The bottom block has at least one irregular square with at least ten cup-marks.

Fig. 24

Here are two sun figures consisting of respectively two and three concentric circles, apparently executed without a compass. Above the figure to the left can be seen the bottom of a cross of the type most common on these church walls. Both sun figures are well and regularly executed. Sun figures consisting of concentric circles with or without a marked centre are exceedingly common in the rock carvings from the Bronze Age.

Fig. 25

The main figure is a larger circle with an inscribed double St Andrew's cross. The circle appears to have been executed with a compass. Inside the circle figure one can see three small and four large cup-shaped hollows. One of the latter constitutes the centre of the circle. To the right of this circle one can glimpse one or perhaps two smaller circles. One of them is also obviously executed with a compass. The centre is formed by a cup-shaped hollow that is part of a group of five. A little further to the right are two vertical rows of small hollows, ten in all. Otherwise the image also shows some more cup-shaped hollows, of which two are of the same size as the four inside the largest circle.

Fig. 26

Sun figure consisting of a circle with an inscribed six-petalled rosette formed by striking circular arcs with the radius of the main circle. The points of this rosette are in turn connected by concave circular arcs. Whether these were struck with a compass is difficult to ascertain.

Fig. 27

Double concentric circle, powerfully carved and with a fairly large, deep cup-shaped hollow at the centre. From the left side of the outermost circle extends a curved line, obviously carved at the same time as the circle. Whether this has any symbolic meaning cannot be determined; but without drawing any conclusions from it, it may be mentioned that closely related figures are found in rock carvings from the Bronze Age. One consisting of a spiral, extended to the side by a curved line, has thus been published from Østfold (Gjessing pl. XV:2), a closely related one has also been published from Skåne (Althin Taf. 59).

Fig. 28

A large sun figure of the same type as fig. 26. The hollow at the centre is deep and clear. It is quite obvious here that the concave circular arcs are carved freehand, which is apparently also the case with the inscribed rosette, while the circle was probably struck with a compass. Through the middle of the two vertical petals of the rosette a line has been carved lengthwise.

Fig. 29

At the top right some lines have been carved in that do not appear to have any significance at all, in addition to two irregular rings, one (the smallest) with a marked centre; the other is a simple wheel cross. In the middle to the left are two figures that cannot be interpreted with any certainty. A figure roughly corresponding to the upper of these can be seen in fig. 33. At the bottom right, on the other hand, is a clear sun symbol, sloppily and irregularly scratched in. The centre is clearly marked by a small but relatively deep hole.

Fig. 30

Most striking are four dot-circles executed with a compass and with exactly the same radius, so that they must have been made at the same time. This must have happened before 1646, since this date is carved deeply in somewhat further down in the image, and the top of the digit 6 just barely extends over one of the circles. In addition to the circles one can see a number of cross figures, apparently made at different times. Through the upper circle to the right a cross has been loosely scratched in after the circle was made. It is of the usual type among these images, with two obliquely placed supports at the foot of the cross. The top and both arms appear to be terminated with short cross-strokes, something that also occurs elsewhere on crosses in these images. Just to the right of this circle is a cross that originally appears to have been of the same form, but which seems to have been re-carved later. It has then acquired deep cup-shaped hollows as the termination of the cross-arms, in addition to three along the stem. This appears to have happened at the same time as the other crosses were made. At the bottom of the image is a tangle of lines that cannot now be interpreted. Over these have been carved a zigzag line and a semicircular figure, possibly a serpent.

Fig. 31

The main figure here is a large serpent with the body formed as a zigzag band. The head, which is at the top, has an open mouth. The eye is marked. The serpent is carved over older lines that cannot now be interpreted. To the left of the serpent are at least three cross figures, of which one is quite loosely scratched in. Above this, a cross with hollows as the termination of the cross-arms has been deeply carved in. This was carved in later than a large cross, also with hollows as the termination of the cross-arms.

Fig. 32

The image shows a good number of different figures. Most prominent is a swastika-like figure at the top. Regular and beautifully executed, positively constructed with a compass. One sees the centre marked both at the ends of the four arms and between them. Each arm is constructed by three circular arcs, of which two have the same radius. Immediately beneath this is the date 1754, obviously made at the same time. To the right of this figure is a cross figure, closest to a Maltese cross, also constructed with a compass. Here too are a number of other, partly older, figures, among them crosses of the usual type, a large curved line that is obviously part of a larger figure that cannot now be interpreted, etc. Further down on the wall there are mainly cross figures, obviously of different ages. Here too is a larger semi-elliptical figure, apparently of the same kind as in fig. 29.

Fig. 33

The main figure here is a larger serpent formed by an irregular zigzag band. To the left of it a ladder-like figure and to the right of it a figure formed by two irregular semicircles. In addition the letter R four times.

Fig. 34

Serpent (?) formed by the two outermost windings of a spiral. Very indistinct so it cannot be determined whether it has a specially formed head. To the left of the serpent some lines have been carved in that cannot be interpreted.

Fig. 35

Large, rather irregular spiral where the outermost line is extended to the side, a figure known from Bronze Age rock carvings (e.g. Gjessing pl. XV:2).

Fig. 36

Serpent (?) formed by a stepped band. At the top it appears to have a head en face.

Fig. 37

Large, indistinct figure. Looks most like a squared rectangle, but there are features that may suggest it is part of a larger figure. There are lines on both sides and at the bottom of the figure that may belong to it.

Fig. 38

The main figure here is a large spiral with 9 windings. It has been overcarved by a number of vertical lines, as well as an inscription BLOM. Right under the B a P has been scratched in. Later than the vertical strokes is a large cross with a three-part foot and a cup-mark as the termination of the upper cross-arm. In continuation of the horizontal cross-arms a long horizontal line has been carved which curves roundly downward and back, so that there are two parallel lines with a third in between them. At the top left one can see the end of an inscription: ON, and at the bottom one reads: MIL and duoAL.

Fig. 39

At the top right a vessel with one mast and pennant, but without sails. However it has a bowsprit for presumably both jib and flying jib. The vessel is a sloop with a transom stern and scarcely older than the 1800s. It has probably been re-scratched, since the pennant appears only to have been carved in, while the lines of both mast and hook have been cut into. Further down is a six-petalled rose inscribed in a circle. The photograph appears to have been taken somewhat at an angle, so the circle is now somewhat elongated, but there is a hole for the compass point both at the centre and at all the petal tips.

Fig. 40

Here there is only one figure, a clumsily drawn three-masted paddle steamer with one square sail in the middle of the mainmast. It dates from the first half of the 1800s. The first propeller-driven steamer was launched in 1841.

Fig. 41

The main figure here is two three-masted sailing ships, both from the 1700s judging by hull and rigging. In the lower part of the image directly above the ship, M has been scratched in, a little further to the right an A and just above it MP. At the top left of the image is a figure that cannot now be interpreted. It looks most like a four-wheeled vehicle of some sort, but this is highly uncertain.

Fig. 42

Consists of a peculiar figure that must most likely be understood as a strongly stylised vessel with one mast and a large square sail. In that case it must be a medieval vessel judging by the form. A line running obliquely out from the sternpost may suggest that the boat had a stern-hung rudder, which in that case would date it to not much earlier than 1200.

Fig. 43

Small vessel with one mast, pennant and a small square sail high up on the mast. The boat appears to have had two stays (fore and jib stays) and bowsprit which however are now not visible. The vessel is obviously a sloop (cutter) and should be datable to the early 1800s.

Fig. 44

Vessel with two masts and square sails with topsails on the mainmast, in addition to a small square sail at the bow. At the stern is a high, obliquely set structure. Probably one of the early sloops from the beginning of the 1700s or somewhat older.

Fig. 45

Two sailing ships, one of them a three-masted full-rigged ship, judging from the rigging from the 1700s. It has both tops and crosstrees, possibly also a topgallant mast. The other vessel is simpler. Of the rigging one sees the foremast with stays and shrouds. In addition one or two more masts are suggested.

Fig. 46

A ketch carved deeply and powerfully into the stone. It has two masts with gaff sails on both, in addition to a small square sail at the top of the mainmast. Fore and jib stays, but no staysails. The ketch, which dates from the 1800s, is carved over a quantity of older lines that are now difficult to interpret. The date 1620 can at least be read, before it possibly ANO and below it a large A.

Fig. 47

Three-masted sailing ship with crosstrees on all three masts, as well as shrouds, but without sails. Clumsily and awkwardly executed, but may have been intended as a warship. 1700s.

Fig. 48

The main figure is an elegantly formed yacht with gaff sail and topsail, as well as foresail, jib and flying jib, and solid shrouds. The bulwark is cross-hatched. The bowsprit rises obliquely upward and is well and solidly stayed on the underside. 1800s. Just in front of the bowsprit is a quite small, clumsily drawn vessel with one mast, apparently gaff sail and jib.

Fig. 49

Very simply and clumsily executed vessel. The type cannot be determined, but judging by the number of portholes ("bull's-eyes"), it must have been intended as a larger vessel. Only one mast amidships is visible.

Fig. 50

Fore-and-aft schooner with gaff and topsails on both masts. The staysails are not marked. Above the vessel a number of lines have been carved in that now give no meaning, and right beneath the schooner are a couple of horizontal, nearly parallel lines that may be remains of an older vessel, but this cannot now be determined with certainty.

Fig. 51

Three-masted, full-rigged vessel, possibly from the 1700s. In that case it probably dates from the end of the century. It has square sails on the mainmast and mizzenmast, possibly also on the foremast; on the other hand it has no staysails and apparently no spanker on the mizzenmast either. The hull itself is clumsily and awkwardly drawn. Here too lines have been carved in that have no direct connection with the vessel and that cannot now be interpreted.

Fig. 52

The rigging and some of the hull of an unusually clumsily executed three-masted full-rigged ship, facing left where one sees part of the topstay and crosstrees stay.

Fig. 53

Two small vessels. The upper one is a three-masted barque, rather clumsily executed. At the top of the mainmast and mizzenmast are flags that nevertheless cannot be more closely determined. Beneath this barque is a small sloop (cutter) with gaff rig and strikingly large sail area, and with stays for foresail, jib and flying jib, possibly also for outer jib. At the masthead there appears to be a

flag or similar. Both vessels appear to have been made at the same time, and in that case can hardly be older than the 1800s, while the three-master, judging by the form and mizzen rig, should rather be from the second half of the 1700s.

Fig. 54

Possibly a strongly stylised three-masted vessel, but the stylisation is carried so far that it can hardly be more closely determined. Here too a number of other lines have been carved in — mostly more or less vertical — that have nothing directly to do with the vessel (?). These for the most part cannot be determined, apart from a cross that at the top ends in a circular figure and with a three-part foot. The figure is very indistinct, and could perhaps be interpreted as a male figure, but the correspondence with other cross figures (fig. 1, 3, 30-32, 81, 115, 118-126) makes the interpretation as a cross probable.

Fig. 55

Clumsily executed yacht with gaff rig and two small square sails at the masthead. The staysails are foresail and jib. Probably from the 1800s.

Fig. 56

Fish, placed vertically and with two dorsal fins. To the right of the fish is an anchor, carved more deeply into the stone.

Fig. 57

Clumsily drawn yacht with gaff rig, fore and jib stays. Not unlike fig. 55 in form.

Fig. 58

Beautifully formed brig with gaff sail on the mizzenmast, flag and standard at the mastheads. The vessel is depicted with a good wind in the sails, both the square sails and the staysails (foresail, jib and flying jib), but nevertheless appears to be depicted lying at anchor. Two parallel lines run in a slight curve from the bow downward, and in all probability represent the anchor chain. Immediately below the brig are some lines that converge downward and that may represent the reflection in the sea. In addition there is a large A. Both the greater part of the brig and these last-mentioned lines have obviously been refreshed by scratching in the lines. 1800s.

Fig. 59

Strongly stylised ship or bird figure. The figure is carved across a corner of the stone block, so that the greater part of it in the photograph falls in shadow, which makes determination difficult. If the interpretation as a ship is correct, it must be a vessel from the early Middle Ages with a strongly curved stemhead at the bow (animal-head shaped?). Above the vessel are some lines that could be interpreted as two or three masts, the first with two square sails one above the other, which again would be difficult to reconcile with the form of the hull. In the middle of the figure at the bottom it appears however that one can glimpse a vertical line ending in a bird-shaped figure. If the figure must be interpreted as a bird, some of the vertical lines above it may be the wings. Both interpretations are very uncertain. Near the stempost (the neck) is a quantity of small hollows, apparently a sun cross on a long stem. The figure is nevertheless very indistinct.

Fig. 60

Strongly schematised vessel with one mast with a flag. Near the stern two parallel oblique lines run downward, probably a steering oar. In that case the vessel dates from the early Middle Ages. To the right of the vessel one can glimpse an S-shaped serpent figure. There are also some other lines that cannot be interpreted.

Fig. 61

Ship or bird figure closely related to fig. 59, but more bird-like. Two parallel vertical lines running up from the middle of the figure could nevertheless be thought to represent a mast. The figure itself is unusually deeply carved in, which is probably because it has been renewed several times. A number of other lines can also be seen.

Fig. 62

A strongly schematised bird figure facing right. The wing is formed as a vertical "herringbone" pattern. Immediately in front of the neck is a sun image. Otherwise there is here a quantity of lines that cannot be interpreted.

Fig. 63

A distinct and clear right-facing bird. Beneath the bird is a wave-shaped horizontal line (serpent?). A number of other lines are difficult to determine.

Fig. 64

Rooster, the symbol of vigilance. It is strongly simplified, but the determination is entirely certain. It clearly shows signs that the lines have been refreshed many times.

Fig. 65

Strongly schematised bird, facing right.

Fig. 66

Clear and distinct bird, facing left. The wing is formed by a quantity of closely set, more or less parallel, vertical lines running up from the back. In the same way the tail is formed by a quantity of closely set lines running out from the rear end. The bird is placed right at a corner of the stone block. On the block below is a good number of figures that cannot be made out. Peacock?

Fig. 67

The main figure is the Rooster of Vigilance, strongly schematised, but the comb and the characteristic tail leave absolutely no doubt about the identification. The rooster is placed immediately above a cross which in turn stands on a roughly semicircular structure, possibly intended as an altar or a chapel. 1. The lower part of this is formed as two squares filled with diagonals and perpendiculars from the sides, in other words the same pattern found in a good number of the square figures (cf. fig. 11, and the text to it). The upper, curved part is horizontally and vertically hatched, possibly meant as the roof of a building. A good number of other, fainter lines cannot be explained.

Fig. 68

The main figure is a footprint (shoe sole) probably from the Romanesque period. The shoe has had a very blunt toe and a cross-hatched heel section. The front end is however not as blunt as the shoe type ("poulaines") that came into use in France under the reign of Louis XI (1423-83). To the left of this is a bare footprint and to the right of the large shoe sole are a good number of mostly vertical lines. Here one also sees a cross where the upper arm is formed as an irregular halo (?) with a small cross and 10 small hollows inside.

Fig. 69

Three footprints (shoe soles) of Gothic type, most likely from the last half of the 1200s.

Fig. 70

Footprint (shoe sole), pointed-toe, relatively broad under the ball of the foot and strongly pinched in the front section. Last half of the 1200s.

Fig. 71

Footprint (shoe sole) (?), very simplified, but quite distinct.

Fig. 72

Footprint (shoe sole) of the same type as fig. 70, but more poorly formed. Last half of the 1200s.

Fig. 73

Two footprints (shoe soles), probably from the Middle Ages. One is fairly pointed-toe. It is on the whole not unlike fig. 72, but the heel section is coarser. The other appears to be more rounded in front. The lines in the two have exactly the same character, giving overall the impression of having been carved at the same time. Probably last half of the 1200s.

Fig. 74

Profile depiction of a leg with shoe. The shoe is rather clumpy, possibly a wooden shoe. It probably dates from the Renaissance period or later.

Fig. 75

Three high-heeled shoes depicted in profile with the Baroque era's characteristic high heel. 1600s. Musketeer shoes?

Fig. 76

At the top is a horseshoe, apparently of medieval type with a broad bow. At the bottom are two footprints (shoe soles) but unlike those depicted earlier, these have the heel pointing up. Both appear to be of the pointed-toe type from the last half of the 1200s. Just above one of them is a small heart and a couple of crosses, the latter carved with much fainter lines, and further down are some hollows. Of these, five are arranged in cross form with a hollow at the centre. One also sees remains of other figures that cannot now be interpreted. The same applies to the area to the left of the other shoe sole.

Fig. 77

Large horseshoe of medieval type with a broad bow and the nail holes near the outer contour.

Fig. 78

Hand figure, carved deeply and distinctly. At the bottom by the wrist is a field with 14 hollows divided by a horizontal line. It is clear that the lines have been secondarily scratched. Here too are some faintly scratched lines. To the left of the wrist are, for example, three vertical lines crossed in the middle by three horizontal ones.

Fig. 79

Hand with part of the arm. This too is a well-known feature from the Bronze Age rock carvings.

Fig. 80

The main figure is a strongly bent arm with the hand, but here are a good number of other figures as well. At the bottom right one sees a horse with its head turned to the right, otherwise there are a number of crosses of the usual type with three-part foot. One of them is placed in direct connection with a tent-like figure, so that the whole could look like a simple, small church building, but whether the connection is intentional cannot be determined. These cross figures are of interest in that they are practically identical to figures that are common in Spanish rock carvings from the Bronze Age, and there interpreted as stylised human figures. The resemblance is so great that it could tempt one to re-examine the dating basis for these carvings. But whether this resemblance has any significance for the symbolic interpretation of the crosses on the Norman church walls is probably difficult to determine (see e.g. Kuhn: Die Felsbilder Europas, Stuttgart 1952, taf. 75).

Fig. 81

Two cross-positioned hands, but both with the thumbs turned to the left. At the bottom left of the image one can glimpse a number of crossing oblique lines.

Fig. 82

Large hand figure with a hollow in the middle of the thumb, and another in the middle of the palm.

Fig. 82 A

The main figure is an arm with hand, and immediately beneath it is a heart, cut through by a vertical line. On both sides of the hand, obviously secondarily, a hand has been scratched in. The one to the left of the arm is exceedingly schematically depicted.

Fig. 83

Here one sees roughly in the middle of the image, somewhat to the right, a strongly schematised hand; in addition a couple of crosses, one of which cuts in over the hand and has obviously been added later than it. Besides these and a few more or less connected lines, one sees five "key"-like figures that I cannot explain.

Fig. 84

Human figure with colossal hands. Over the middle section of the body a spiral has been carved. The figure is possibly intended as the crucified Christ, but the enormous hands lead the mind unbidden back to a figure often found in the rock carvings from the Bronze Age, "the God with the great hands".

Fig. 85

Again a human figure with strikingly large hands, strongly schematised, and executed in an entirely different style from fig. 84. Cf. "the God with the great hands".

Fig. 86

Human figure, possibly intended as a pregnant female figure, although no female garment is suggested. On both sides of the figure one can glimpse a number of lines that cannot now be interpreted.

Fig. 87

The main figures are two human figures, one headless. Both figures appear to have been carved in at the same time judging by the style. The figure to the left is carved over a cross figure of the usual type with three-part foot, which also forms the legs of the human figure. Presumably by analogy with this, the other figure has also been given the same three-part lower body, something which may even have accentuated that these are male figures. A little higher up and to the left of the headless figure, a semicircle of exactly the same character as the head of the man to the left has been carved. Otherwise here too a number of now indistinct lines have been carved in. The cross and the man to the left are carved over a tall, rectangular figure. Otherwise one can faintly glimpse a couple of cross figures of the usual type, as well as a number of lines that cannot now be interpreted.

Fig. 88

Clumsily drawn male figure with a circular, large head and thick, almost pear-shaped body filled with oblique cross-hatching. The arms are stretched straight out to the sides as if the figure were meant to depict the crucified Christ.

Fig. 89

Hand with a little of the forearm, carved into the wall.

Fig. 90

Again a male figure with strikingly large hands (cf. fig. 84-85). This one too is carved over other lines that cannot now be explained.

Fig. 91

Human figure carved strikingly deeply into the wall. It holds its hand in front of the sexual organ. The figure is carved in after a good number of other figures that can now only partially be interpreted. The foot section is carved over a sun symbol of a not uncommon rock carving type. It has a sun cross in the middle and around it a dense wreath of radial rays. Reference may be made to a sun image from Østfold, Norway (Gjessing 1939, pl. IX:3), where the sun itself is nevertheless formed by concentric circles. Otherwise here is a ladder-like figure at the bottom right (cf. fig. 33), and at the far left of the image one can glimpse a cross figure of the usual type.

Fig. 92

Two human figures, one with a wheel cross as a head. This peculiar feature is found again in a rock carving from Østfold, Norway (Gjessing, 1939, pl. X:2, XI:2), where the sun god has both head and body (shield?) formed as a sun wheel. He is moreover equipped with axe and sword. Otherwise the carving consists of a sun wheel at the top and in addition a good number of ship figures that have obviously been added successively. It is undeniably difficult to see the motive for such a figure here, unless there was a tradition from pre-Christian times.

Fig. 93

Rider scene (?). The horse is well and confidently characterised, but rather awkward in the drawing. The placement of the male figure may create doubt as to whether it is a rider or a case of crimen bestialitatis.

Fig. 94

Ploughing scene: a man ploughing with a wheeled plough. The horse is only loosely scratched in, the same applies to parts of the plough, while the man is more strongly carved in (possibly refreshed later). Right below the horse is another horse pulling a two-wheeled vehicle. There is a large flake in the stone that makes it impossible now to determine whether it is a cart or an agricultural implement. The horse is carved over a cross figure. Here there are also a couple of other crosses with cup-marks as the termination of the cross-arms. Between the two horses are seven powerful cup-marks arranged in a circle with the centre marked. Ritual ploughing scenes are rather common in the rock carvings from the Bronze Age. The ritual character is clearly evident from a Bohuslän carving where the ploughman holds a spruce tree ("the evergreen tree") as a fertility symbol in his hand (Almgren, 1926-27 fig. 71). Horses pulling two- or four-wheeled carts are very common.

Fig. 95

Stag. The stag is an old and well-known Nordic sun symbol, very common in the rock carvings, but it lives on in religious tradition in the North down into the Viking Age and later, as one sees from the Edda poetry's solarhjörtr.

Fig. 96

The main figure here is also a stag. The connection with the religious stag tradition is here further substantiated by a sun symbol (a relatively large circle with the centre marked) somewhat higher up on the wall. Otherwise there are a good number of cup-marks that further tie it into an old Bronze Age tradition.

Fig. 97

The main figure is again a stag, obviously one of the very youngest figures in the image. The antlers cut in over a rectangular frame around an altar-like structure. To the right of this is a large bird that can now essentially only be glimpsed, it appears to be a dove or a peacock. Otherwise it is difficult to make sense of all the faint lines that can be glimpsed.

Fig. 98

Again a stag. The photograph is not particularly clear, but there do not appear to be any other figures in this image.

Fig. 99

Stag, deeply and powerfully carved into the stone. Immediately in front of the chest is the date 1753, obviously contemporary with the stag. Higher up is an inscription that is difficult to read, as well as a date from the 1780s (the last digit cannot be read).

Fig. 100

Apparently again a stag, but the head has not been included in the photograph. The hindquarters in particular are more naturalistically formed than the figures otherwise in this book. Between the pairs of lines a triangular face is carved fairly loosely in, and in the middle of the body a monogram IK or HK was later made. High up to the right in the image is again a triangular face. Otherwise there are a good number of lines that cannot be combined into interpretable figures.

Fig. 101

Stag.

Fig. 102

Unusually clumsily formed four-legged animal, probably either a horse or a stag. The feet end in cup-shaped hollows. The animal is carved over a good number of faint and indistinct lines that for the most part cannot be interpreted. Right above the back of the animal one can probably glimpse a church tower and to the left of it, above the head of the animal, a sun image formed as a many-spoked wheel. We are probably dealing with the same motif as in fig. 160-161.

Fig. 103

In the upper field is a four-legged animal, obviously a stag, in addition to a number of other lines that cannot now be interpreted. The main figure in the lower field is also a stag, depicted in an entirely distinctive manner in that the lines are formed by dense rows of short oblique lines. There also appear to be a good number of cross figures carved into the stone. Furthest to the right is a large, powerfully carved cross with a halo around the upper cross-arm. At the bottom, fairly far to the left of the image, a considerably smaller cross on an almost circular base. In addition a large R is carved in.

Fig. 104

Powerfully carved animal figure, probably again a stag. Both the body and the long, slender neck have been filled with cross-strokes. There are also some other lines here.

Fig. 105

Small four-legged animal. The characterisation is so weak that the species cannot be determined. It may be a stag, but it could also be a calf or a lamb (Christ symbol?). Higher up, at the far right of the image, is probably a rectangular or square figure of roughly the same kind as a common type in these carvings, fig. 140-149, 155-157, 163. In addition a couple of small crosses.

Fig. 106

Difficult to identify figure.

Fig. 107

The only thing that can be identified with certainty here is a horse figure, in addition to some larger cup-marks. The horse has obviously been carved in after a larger, gate-like figure consisting of two vertical double lines with a horizontal cross-line binding them together. This in turn has been carved in later than an unidentifiable animal figure to the right, fairly high up in the image. It may be a stag, as it appears to have antlers. On the left side the gate-like figure cuts over the lines of a

standard-like figure. A horizontal drop-shaped figure in the middle of the image also cannot be explained.

Fig. 108

Large horse figure. Two pairs of vertical lines running up from the horse's back may be thought to have represented a rider. They are now so faint that they can only be glimpsed, and the interpretation of a rider is very uncertain. There are also other lines here that cannot be interpreted. Further down in the image there appears to be a smaller, strongly schematised rider.

Fig. 109

Here is a veritable jumble of figures and lines on four blocks in the wall. Five horses are fairly certain. They obviously date partly from different periods. One, on the block at the bottom left, has the powerful mane that is characteristic of some 1700s depictions. On the same block are remains of an inscription. On three of the blocks there are also some cup-marks.

Fig. 110

Here too are a quantity of lines, partly quite faintly scratched in, but also some figures that are more sharply marked. A stag with large antlers is entirely clear. There may be another one. Likewise two horse figures are certain enough. There are also some small but clearly marked cup-marks.

Fig. 111

Right-facing horse. Right-facing animals are relatively rare in these church carvings. At the bottom right are seven cup-marks arranged in cross form.

Fig. 112

Very indistinct horse figure. It has been powerfully carved in, but the stone appears to be strongly weathered. Some lines that cannot be interpreted can also be seen, and there appears to be a bird on the horse's back.

Fig. 113

A jumble of figures, letters, and unidentifiable lines. A right-facing, running horse, probably with a rider, is certain enough, likewise a cross on a structure roughly like a truncated pyramid. Of the inscriptions, the only one that can be read with any degree of certainty is: FRANC, at the bottom right. Some cup-marks, of which a couple are large and deep.

Fig. 114

A large four-legged animal (with its head turned backward) biting itself in the tail. The style must most closely be characterised as "peasant-Romanesque". The animal appears to stand on a low pedestal. Some cup-marks in an almost horizontal row above the back of the animal are obviously of a more recent date, as one of them is carved over the neck contour of the animal.

Fig. 115

Cross figure, largely of the usual type, but the stem is much thicker than the cross-arms and ends in a large cup-shaped hollow, which may suggest that it is a male representation, either the crucified Christ or something similar to the Iberian rock carving figures mentioned earlier (cf. fig. 80). Over this, in relatively recent times, the number 19 has been scratched in, possibly two digits of a date. To the left of the cross is a figure that looks most like an unfinished animal figure. The legs are missing.

Fig. 116

Here are five, if not six horses, and below them is a stag with a many-spoked sun wheel immediately above. Judging by the style, all these figures are roughly contemporary and then also contemporary with an animal figure somewhat to the right of centre on the bottom block to the right in fig. 109. Otherwise here is a large ladder figure, if not two, and a good number of unidentifiable figures and lines, as well as a large and deep cup-shaped hollow with radial "rays".

Fig. 117

The central figure is a horizontal oval on a long stake that stands on a foot consisting of three oblique lines on each side of the central stem. Both the foot and the oval are recognised from other depictions in this book, then always on crosses in various designs. The oval can be placed alongside fig. 135 and fig. 133 where it is not an oval but a square. One could also mention fig. 126 with a circle (halo?). In fig. 117, however, there appears to be a small human face inside the oval. The entire figure is placed on a horizontal, obviously long line. There are also some other figures here. Above the main figure is a strongly schematised depiction of a human being, most likely Christ on the cross, a type that is very common in these church carvings, see e.g. fig. 119, 121, 122. Below the long baseline are some unidentifiable figures.

Fig. 118

Large cross of the usual type. Ends at the top in a cup-mark. Of these there are several.

Fig. 119

At the top left, the three-part foot of a cross, probably of the usual type. Below it a wavy line (serpent?). Otherwise here are some circles, partly dot-circles, partly cut through with a long vertical line. There are also a couple of deeply carved crosses with oblique lines from the arms towards the central stem, possibly crucifixion scenes. Some cup-marks are also present. A vertically placed wavy line almost at the top left of the image possibly represents a serpent.

Fig. 120

A quantity of crosses of different but common types. In addition masses of cup-marks, for the most part in direct connection with the crosses. Partly as the termination of the cross-arms, partly in other ways. A cross at the top left has a triangular top field filled with hollows.

Fig. 121

The most noteworthy figures here are some cup-marks that are obviously sun symbols, as a quantity of radial rays extend out from them. Otherwise here are mainly crosses, most of the type with oblique lines from the cross-arms towards the central stem, although there are also other forms.

Fig. 122

Large cross figure with cup-marks at the ends of the cross-arms and oblique lines inward towards the central stem.

Fig. 123

Smaller cross figure of the same type as fig. 122, in addition to some more cup-marks.

Fig. 124

A quantity of crosses of different types, in addition a "sun wheel" with 12 spokes, a dot-circle, some cup-marks as well as lines that cannot now be interpreted.

Fig. 125

Dot-circle surrounded by two large concentric circles. On each side of these is a strongly effaced vertical line. Later a cross with a triangular foot and cross-strokes at the ends of the cross-arms has been carved in.

Fig. 126

Consists of a figure — a circle cut through by a vertical line that ends in a triangular foot. Maypole?

Fig. 127

Here is a quantity of figures, among them a good number of smaller crosses of somewhat varying forms, one of them placed in a square frame. There are also some cup-marks and a quantity of mainly vertical lines that are now difficult to interpret. The main figure is nevertheless two peculiar figures consisting of a vertical line with a quantity of oblique lines downward from the central line. Both end at the top in a cross. No certain interpretation of these can be given. There is perhaps a possibility — if somewhat remote — that they represent spruce trees — the "evergreen tree" which already in the Bronze Age carvings represents the fertility of the earth.

Fig. 128

The main figure is a small cross figure on an exceedingly large, triangular pedestal consisting of a quantity of oblique lines down from the central stem. Above this figure is another, somewhat similar one consisting of five vertical lines on a somewhat similar pedestal. At the top the lines are cut across by oblique lines so that a grid pattern is formed.

Fig. 129

In a round-arched frame one sees in the middle a "Russian cross" on a triangular base, and on each side of it a cross with only one crossbeam and one oblique beam. The "Russian cross" must probably go back to Byzantine influences. The oblique beam symbolises, as is well known, the Resurrection. It is conceivable that the entire figure symbolises a grave memorial, as "Russian crosses" are said to occur on gravestones also within the Roman Catholic Church.

Fig. 130

In a roughly similar frame to fig. 129 is a cross with one crossbeam and oblique beam. The cross-arms end in cup-marks and around the top hollow as well as on the sides of the main stem are some hollows. Therefore possibly also symbolising a grave memorial.

Fig. 131

Three cross figures, of which one without and one with a simple triangular base. The third has a quantity of oblique strokes downward on both sides of the main stem (cf. fig. 127-128).

Fig. 132

Two crosses, both with triangularly terminated cross-arms, one on a rectangular, chequered base, the other on a normal triangular base. There are also some letters here, among them an inscription that cannot now be read on the photograph.

Fig. 133

A number of powerfully carved cross figures of different types, most with a triangular base. One of them has a square with an inscribed cross in the middle of the main stem. Another cross right beside it has the crossbeam formed as a narrow ellipse. At the top right a ladder-shaped figure (Jacob's Ladder?). Under these powerfully carved figures is a layer of figures that are scratched in quite loosely. At the far left is a similar ladder to the one mentioned above, but larger. In addition one can discern a long horizontal line ending in a spiral. A cross, a circle figure and the inscription OSL appear to have been scratched in in recent times.

Fig. 134

The entire image surface is strewn with figures, mostly crosses of different types and cup-marks, in addition a six-spoked wheel etc., among other things the letters RJBE.

Fig. 135

Large and deeply carved cross figure on a rectangular, chequered base. The cross-arms end in cup-marks and the central stem continues upward, where it has an almost semicircular figure across the stem. To the right of this the letters NP, to the left IN. To the right of the base another cross that ends at the bottom in a circle figure. There are also some other lines that cannot be interpreted from the photograph alone.

Fig. 136

Large cross on a triangular base. At the crossing a rhombic figure. There are also some apparently randomly placed hollows and a small spectacle-shaped figure.

Fig. 137

Cross on a triangular pedestal with five parallel horizontal lines. The cross is more elaborate than usual. Stem and beam are broad and consist of three parallel lines. The termination of the cross-arms appears to have had an almost fan shape.

Fig. 138

Cross on a stepped pedestal with a cup-mark at all line crossings and angles. The cross is carved over a quantity of indistinct lines that cannot now be combined into interpretable figures.

Fig. 139

A smaller and a larger cross formed only by cup-marks.

Fig. 140

Almost square figure with irregular diagonal lines and a vertical centre line that continues outside the figure on both top and bottom. The diagonals also continue outside on the underside. From the right side edge a semicircular arc extends, and inside it are four hollows. There are also some other lines that cannot now be explained, in addition the letters JIS upside down.

Fig. 141

Almost rectangular figure with an inscribed double cross and hollows at all line crossings. There are also several other hollows and lines here.

Fig. 142

Three square figures with inscribed double crosses, two of them rather insignificant. At the bottom the date 1749 is carved unusually powerfully and obviously later than one of the squares.

Fig. 143

Large square figure with an inscribed double cross and a cup-mark at the centre.

Fig. 144

Two square figures. One consists of three squares inside one another and with an inscribed double cross. The figure thereby simultaneously takes on the character of a "mill" board. The other has a cup-mark at the centre and 16 radial lines. There are also some other apparently randomly placed cup-marks and the bottom field is cross-hatched. In the first figure there is also a dot-circle, obviously made before the square.

Fig. 145

Two upright, rectangular figures with a cross inside and oblique lines forming an almost star-shaped pattern. Both are completely alike.

Fig. 146

A quantity of lines and hollows. The latter are mainly placed in lines in different directions. Furthermore one can discern a square

with a double cross and an obliquely placed rectangle filled with cross-strokes and with a longitudinal line through the middle.

Fig. 147

Square with a double cross and a large cup-mark in the middle.

Fig. 148

"Mill" board (nine men's morris). There are also some other lines here that cannot now be combined into interpretable figures.

Fig. 149

Three squares inside one another with a horizontal line running through the middle. Whether there was also a vertical centre line cannot now be ascertained.

Fig. 150

The figures here are difficult to make out because of the heavy lichen growth. Three parallel lines that at the bottom end in a horizontal rectangle filled with some kind of geometric pattern on the right side and a standing triple rectangle on the left, are clear enough. To the right of the vertical lines apparently a date.

Fig. 151

Wheel cross with a cup-mark at the centre. Inside the circle an approximately square chequered pattern.

Fig. 152

Trapezoidal figure with arc segments along the top and both side edges. The trapezoid itself is divided into three, so that a narrower trapezoid emerges in the middle, filled with diagonals and a vertical line from the point of intersection to the bottom edge. The side fields are filled with a zigzag line.

Fig. 153

A jumble of mainly horizontal and vertical lines that cannot now be combined into meaningful figures, even though one can glimpse a couple of squares and a triangle.

Fig. 154

At the top is an almost rectangular figure with a smaller trapezoid divided by diagonals on the top (church?). Below are two crosses. One standing on a kind of table or similar. All line terminations are formed as cup-marks. The other has three-part cross-arms. At one cross-arm there is also a vertical stroke that again ends in a three-part form.

Fig. 155

At the top three squares inside one another and divided by centre lines, so that it becomes a "mill" board. Below this a church seen from the west, so that it consists only of a rectangle with a triangle ending in a cross above. There are also some cup-marks here.

Fig. 156

At the top three squares inside one another and below it a church with tower, nave and apse. It is carved over some strongly weathered lines that cannot now be interpreted. To the right of the church a drop-shaped figure carved in deep bas-relief. Below the church is a stone that is completely strewn with small hollows. Further to the right some vertical lines. Other stone blocks in the lower rows also appear to have been strewn with hollows.

Fig. 157

At the top are two squares inside one another with a cup-mark at the centre and a vertical centre line. There are also some apparently random lines here. Further down one sees a strongly schematised human head in profile with a vertical line downward (part of the body?). There is also possibly a church here (cf. fig. 155-156 with squares above churches), and some other lines.

Fig. 158

Clumsily and schematically formed church with tower seen from one of the long walls.

Fig. 159

Quite detailed church with tower and a smaller roof turret. Above the church is an inscription, apparently: IACQUE, and below the first letters an almost trapezoidal figure consisting of two triangles with a horizontal line between the apex angles. Below this again a small, oblique field with cross-hatching.

Fig. 160

Sun symbol consisting of a circle with closely set radii and a cup-mark in the middle. To the left of this a church with a tall tower and apparently a transept, seen from the east.

Fig. 161

Two rather similarly shaped churches with towers, seen from the south long side. To the right of these a sun symbol, formed as a circle with closely set radii and with a cup-mark at the centre.

Fig. 162

The main figure is a church with a tall tower with a cross-shaped spire. Obviously of older date is a good number of mostly vertical, but also horizontal and curved lines that cannot now be interpreted.

Fig. 163

Here the inscription LVMEN appears several times, partly completed, partly only begun: LV. They appear to be of different ages. Across a couple of these inscriptions a roughly rectangular, upright figure with a curved top has been carved. It is divided into two fields by a horizontal line. The upper field is divided by diagonals, the lower has six parallel vertical lines. At the bottom one sees the top of a deeply carved cross. Otherwise here are lines that cannot now be deciphered.

Fig. 164

Two medieval shields of the small, flat type that was in use between 1250 and into the first half of the 1300s. One is divided by a cross, the other by a vertical centre line and two horizontal lines.

Fig. 165

The main figure (to the right of the image) is apparently a strongly schematised church with the front covered by parallel vertical lines. It is carved over (and later than) a cross of the usual type with a triangular foot. There are also a good number of other lines here that are now difficult to interpret. In one place (to the left of the image) there is possibly a small cross of the usual type inside a square frame, evidently also from an older layer. On the other hand, the letter P (carved on the left side of the image) is probably of a more recent date.

Fig. 166

Here too are several layers of figures, but the oldest are difficult to make out. At the top right are two vertical parallel lines. A little to the left of these the number 65, probably remains of a date, but the number has in turn been carved over older figures. At the top one sees the inscription PIERRE L. Along the entire image, to the left, a vertical row of short horizontal strokes. There are also some powerfully carved oblique strokes. In addition some apparently randomly placed hollows, two powerfully carved crosses of the usual type with cup-marks at all line terminations, and a four-legged animal, strongly schematised, with a long, cross-stroked neck, probably a stag.

Fig. 167

The main figure is a large rooster (Vigilance) with comb and

large, waving tail. Above the tail, and later than it, a broad ladder-like figure has been carved in. There are also some cup-shaped hollows, and a layer of lines older than the rooster, but these cannot now be combined into meaningful figures.

Fig. 168

At the top right of the image is a cross figure of the usual type with a triangular foot section. Right beside it a "ladder". Otherwise there are some lines here that cannot be interpreted, among them a cross-hatched triangle with somewhat curved lines. Some hollows have also been carved in here, and in the middle of the image a deep semicircular figure.

Fig. 169

Two tall, narrow ovals filled with cross-strokes. To the right of these two vertical, nearly parallel lines.

Fig. 170

Some nearly geometric figures, mainly approximately triangular and hatched with lines parallel to two of the sides.

Fig. 171

Two intertwined hearts made with a continuous line.

Fig. 172

A single heart.

Fig. 173

Regular, well-executed figure consisting of an "eight-petalled rose" with an interlaced square. The figure is made with broad bands. Below this, an inscription BRIICOLE (?) has later been carelessly scratched in, in addition to some other lines.

Fig. 174

A pentagram and a hexagram. In addition the inscription ALORI.

Fig. 175

Five sets of double hearts, all with a small cross at the top. They are all more irregularly formed than fig. 171. Below these figures the inscription PIERRELERO.

Fig. 176

Two bells, probably church bells, carved over a layer of older figures that cannot now be interpreted.

Fig. 177

At the top a powerfully marked spectacle-shaped figure. At the bottom a cross with cup-marks in all cross-arms and a large cup-mark at the line crossing. From this, radial "rays" extend downward to both sides. There are also some apparently random lines. A sundial?

Fig. 178

A jumble of lines that can only partially be analysed. A little to the right, in the middle of the image, a figure that should perhaps be interpreted as a spruce tree. The spruce tree, "the evergreen tree", is the tree of life, a symbol of fertility in earth, plants, animals and humans, and, as previously mentioned, a common motif in the Bronze Age carvings. The interpretation is nevertheless far from certain. Otherwise there are some letters here: G, Q, and possibly C.

Fig. 179

Large French lily, fleur, probably from the Middle Ages. It is deeply and powerfully carved into the stone over older, now unidentifiable lines. Higher up in the image are some lines that cannot now be interpreted.

Fig. 180

Three French lilies of very closely related forms, but one obviously older than the other two. Probably medieval. There are also some other lines that cannot be interpreted.

Fig. 181

Strongly weathered and schematised French lily, in addition to a few cup-marks.

Fig. 182

Large gallows with a schematised French lily hanging. This remarkable figure could indeed support Asger Jorn's information that there is a connection between the heraldic lily and the mandrake. It is to be noted here that the mandrake did not belong to popular but to learned magic.

Fig. 183

A jumble of lines, among them at least two gallows and a dozen cup-marks. It cannot be determined whether anyone is hanging from the gallows.

Fig. 184

The main figure is a gallows with a person hanging. To the left of the gallows are some horizontally placed zigzag lines, and furthest to the left a simple serpent figure. To the right is apparently the letter P in addition to some other lines.

Fig. 185

In the middle of the image a large gallows with a person hanging. Just to the left of it apparently a strongly schematised rider. There are also some lines that cannot be combined into interpretable figures.

Fig. 186

Large, exceedingly strongly schematised rider with a cylindrical headgear.

Fig. 187

Large, clumsily executed, but apparently naturalistically intended rider. The horse has a standing mane and even the hairs on the body are marked. It stands with its somewhat crooked forelegs upon a small cubic block. The rider has a sword at his side, and a garment on the upper body that most likely suggests a dating to the 1100s-1200s. The head and neck are so weathered that they can barely be ascertained. Higher up in the image there appears to be an inscription that cannot now be read.

Fig. 188

Quite unusually strongly schematised rider with a large head. The body, arms and legs are only marked with simple lines. In one hand he holds a weapon, probably a sword. Higher up is a powerfully carved inscription, but due to the cropping of the image it is now so incomplete that it cannot be read. One can apparently see NLLE.

Fig. 189

Rider. The figure is difficult to date. The horse is contour-drawn with thick, clumsily formed legs and a short tail that appears to be tightly wound with a band or similar, so that it stands out horizontally.

Fig. 190

Rider, exceedingly strongly schematised and clumsy in form. Moreover it is so weathered that details cannot be discerned.

Fig. 191

Apparently a rider. The horse is formed almost as a crooked narrow triangle where the head and rear form the pointed angles, and the back is blunt. Strongly weathered. There are also some other, strongly weathered lines and in addition some cup-shaped hollows, of which three (four?) form the horse's hooves.

Fig. 192

A good number of more or less incomprehensible lines, among them parts of a now illegible inscription and a strongly schematised horse figure.

Fig. 193

To the right of the image is a peculiar elongated figure consisting of a square with double contour and with an inscribed double cross, cf. fig. 141-144, 147. At the bottom edge of the square is a zigzag line, and at the top edge the figure is drawn far out, and partly filled with lines that cannot now be identified in detail. To the left of this figure is a simple, deeply carved cross and above the whole a large W and apparently another letter, possibly E.

Fig. 194

Pointed-oval figure, possibly with a cup-mark in the middle. To the left of this one can also glimpse the remains of another figure.

Fig. 195

Figure, most like a narrow triangle with the apex pointing down and slightly curved sides. Could be thought to depict a dagger or similar. There are also some other lines here.

Fig. 196

T-shaped figure, strikingly deeply carved in.

Fig. 197

Large key (?) with a ring-shaped head and a four-sided bit consisting of three horizontal parallel lines. The stem cuts over one arm of a cross (and is carved later than it) with cup-marks in the cross-arms.

Fig. 198

Two, possibly three, roughly similar keys (?). One has a large cup-mark as a head, the other has no marked head, the third (?) has only a short stub of the stem.

Fig. 200

The image is divided in two by the crack between two building stones. On the upper half the main figure is an exceedingly schematised human figure consisting of two slightly diverging lines forming the body and legs and two angled lines (the arms). To the left of this is a vertical line and at the very edge of the image the date (1712). The lower half also has a similar human figure in addition to at least 15 cup-shaped hollows and a couple of vertical, faint lines.

Fig. 201 (This photograph is upside down).

Most marked here are two vertical parallel lines, powerfully and deeply carved in. Immediately to the right of the lower end of them is an almost equilateral triangle. Further to the left beside two shorter, vertical parallel lines that appear to be part of a larger figure, are two new triangles, one with hollows in all corners, the other most like a heart with the point upward. At the top of the image one sees at least three pairs of curved lines that also appear to be parts of larger figure(s). There are also, particularly to the right of the image, some other lines that are difficult to interpret, as well as cup-marks. Six of them are placed in an oblique line.

Fig. 202

To the left an exceedingly strongly schematised human figure that is strikingly reminiscent of certain prehistoric French menhirs (cf. also fig. 204). Otherwise there are some lines here, among them a zigzag line, possibly the letter M.

Fig. 203

Strongly schematised human figure with the High Middle Ages' long tunic. The head is roughly circular with eyes, nose and mouth marked with dots and lines. The body is marked by two parallel lines, which at the bottom where the tunic becomes wider, are marked by an oblique line on each side.

Fig. 204

Large human figure. Very reminiscent of fig. 202, but this one has both arms and legs marked.

Fig. 205

Four stone blocks from a church wall photographed together. Three of them undoubtedly have human figures depicted, and two of these are reproduced separately, fig. 92, 207, where they are described in more detail. The bottom block has a human figure in the same style as the tallest and narrowest figure on the upper block to the left. In addition there is one, possibly two crosses with cup-marks at the termination of the cross-arms. The block at the top right has a good number of apparently random lines, among them a rounding that could be thought to be the head of an exceedingly schematised human figure.

Fig. 206

Several human figures, among them a male figure with a tall triangular shield from the 1200s. To the left of this another, similar shield. The man apparently has a long, floor-length tunic. At the far right of the image is a strongly schematised human figure. In the middle of the image is a large human head. Otherwise there are a good number of lines that cannot be combined into identifiable figures.

Fig. 207

Two strongly schematised human figures, also depicted in fig. 205, top left. The figure to the right appears to have a necklace. Just above the head of this one is a very indistinct sun wheel. Both figures are carved over older lines of the same character as the sun wheel. In addition to these lines there are also, to the left of the image, two or three roundings.

Fig. 208

Five human figures, probably from the 1500s-1600s. Three of them are depicted in detail, fig. 209-210. They appear to be two couples with a woman in the middle. The male figure furthest to the left has a short Renaissance doublet.

Fig. 209

The couple furthest to the left in fig. 208. The gender difference is clearly marked both through dress and hairstyle.

Fig. 210

The female figure furthest to the right in fig. 208.

Fig. 211

Human head, apparently of a man, seen in profile. The face is missing due to the cropping of the photograph. In the middle above the neck a cross of the usual type has been carved in, with three-part foot and cup-marks in the cross-arms. There are also some other lines here.

Fig. 212

Strongly schematised human figure, probably a man with a half-length tunic. Across the chest section is a curved line that may suggest that the man has a hood with a shoulder cape (capuchon). In that case the figure dates from the Middle Ages.

Fig. 213

Male head in profile. The eye is formed by a cup-mark and from the tip of the nose five hollows run in a straight oblique line.

Fig. 214

Male head in profile with beard.

Fig. 215

A jumble of lines and figures. The most prominent figure is a male head in profile with a mail coif so that only the nose and the eye area are uncovered. This figure is seen at the top right. At the bottom left is a small horse figure. Otherwise one can discern a cross on a segment-shaped base at the top left and just to the right of it, a circle struck with a compass. There are also three deep cup-marks.

Fig. 216

Peculiar, strongly schematised human figure. The head consists of an approximately rhombic figure with an inscribed cross and double contour (cf. fig. 92). The outer contour continues at the bottom into an oval that surrounds the body. Here too there is a double contour. The body is formed by a vertical line that at the bottom divides into two curved legs. The arms are curved somewhat upward. The figure may perhaps represent a Christ in mandorla, but this is highly uncertain. Around the lower part of the human figure are five cup-marks.

Fig. 217

Large figure that covers almost the entire image field. The stone is so weathered that the figure can scarcely be interpreted with certainty, but it must most likely be understood as a human figure.

Fig. 218

To the left of the image is a human head en face, possibly the entire figure is depicted, but the stone is so overgrown with lichen that this cannot be said with certainty. In that case it has straight, outstretched arms depicted in contour carving and a body consisting of three vertical lines. An oblique line also runs from the "body" downward to the right. At the top right of the image is a circle, possibly with cup-marks that may represent eyes. Otherwise there are a couple of shorter curved lines and a zigzag line.

Fig. 219

Face en face marked by deep hollows.
