## Asger Jorn: Origins and Paths of Unity

The art of "Cobra" distinguishes itself from other tendencies of its era by its starting point, which represents a new perspective on abstract art. One could say that it is an abstract art that does not believe in abstraction. The awareness of this new perspective was expressed clearly and precisely in the study "Symboler i abstrakt kunst" by the Danish painter Vilhelm Bjerke Petersen, in which he demonstrated for the first time, in an original way, the symbolic content of abstractions. Thus the idea of abstraction as a pictorial goal was definitively compromised. Where had Bjerke Petersen gotten these ideas? From the former Bauhaus, through which he had passed just before the Nazis destroyed it. In terms of arrangement and layout, the book was a new work in the series of "Bauhausbücher" which contain theories by Mondrian, Van Doesburg, Malevitch, Klee, Kandinsky, and others. In terms of content, the obvious continuation that one could foresee was a new development from the moment when one would have adopted the new Freudian psychology and the results of the Surrealist development in Paris, had the development not been so abruptly halted.

The great artistic development in Denmark, from Bjerke Petersen's book in 1933 until the end of the war, is thus inseparable from the political event that paralysed cultural life in Germany during the same period. But the new perspective was not established by this book. A long and contradictory development had to take place before all the elements necessary for this perspective were found. Bjerke Petersen was not even aware of the revolutionary originality of his work. He opposed these ideas two years later by joining Breton's ideas with a new theory called Surrealism. But artists like Richard Mortensen and Ejler Bille, inspired by the initial ideas, refused to revise them and expelled Bjerke Petersen from "Linien," the artistic group formed on the new basis. This development attracted several new artists in the following years, and a new upheaval was being prepared with the method of spontaneous colourism by Egill Jacobsen. Richard Mortensen's attachment to abstraction placed him increasingly in opposition to this new tendency, and in 1939 the rupture was inevitable. The "Linien" era was over, a new era of multiple tendencies or lines was beginning around the journal "Helhesten," while Richard Mortensen participated in the founding of the journal "Aarstiderne," just as Bjerke Petersen in 1937 had opposed "Linien" with the Surrealist journal "Konkretion."

With the end of the war, the privileged situation of Danish artists came to an end. Adjustment to the international situation created a new crisis. The language that the Dutch movement "de Stijl" had so evidently imposed on the forms of the former Bauhaus was already thoroughly exhausted in its native country, and it was with an immediate understanding of its upheaval that some Dutch artists came together in the "Reflex" group in 1947, to draw the extreme consequences of the Danish development in relation to their predispositions. It was a new explosion that created new ruptures among the Danes, some joining the new development and founding "Cobra," others refusing it. The fuse had burned down to the charge, and the explosion took place at the "Cobra" exhibition in Amsterdam in 1948.
Personally, I was not directly involved in the preparatory developments in Germany and Denmark. I left my small provincial town in 1936 to go directly to Paris and begin to be an artist. I knew that Kandinsky was there and had imagined that he had a school. But he was not even able to obtain a solo exhibition of his paintings before his death, and so I went to the academy of Fernand Léger, which had the advantage of forcing me to see things in an entirely new way, to adapt to the French perspective. This subsequently left me with the possibility of seeing the entire development set out here with a certain detachment. At least that is what I believe. It is for others to judge.

The former Bauhaus had shown that a new artistic development could have a technical consequence, which was already the basic thesis of Ruskin and Morris. The former Bauhaus had absorbed the artistic results of the "Der blaue Reiter" group and the "De Stijl" group, exploiting them without giving anything back to the artists. It was an exploit that was at the same time almost a liquidation. It is significant that the only painter gifted with a revolutionary effectiveness who had been in direct contact with the former Bauhaus was not a painter, but a photographer who subsequently, in Paris, was to become the painter Wols.

This disastrous development, which clearly reflected earlier and equally unconscious developments regarding the relationship between art and technology, brought out the contour of a definite structure, which imposed the probability of a similar repetition for the new artistic revolution. But this awareness could at the same time serve to find a method capable of avoiding this outcome by establishing a correlation between artistic and technical developments simultaneously. This was facilitated by the fact that the back-and-forth was accelerating in speed, to the point that the reaction was already being prepared simultaneously with the action itself.

This programme had already been proposed and explained in a study on style and ornament that I had published in the architecture journal "Forum," in Holland, in 1947.

The aim of the activity for an Imaginist Bauhaus, as explained here, was the establishment of this method-tactic, or if one wishes to express it sincerely, technique. By applying a technique to art, even if the goal is anti-technical, one perhaps arrives at a betrayal, or a negation, of free art. But I see no way to escape this necessity. I do not believe that artistic power will succumb in this change of conditions, but I am convinced that if nothing were done, art would cease to exist, and man with it, in the sense in which we have here ultimately accepted the word existence as the expression of a situation.

With the founding of the Experimental Group Reflex, in Holland, in 1948, a movement was formed for the first time in the history of art on a basis whose importance during the war (especially in Denmark) had proven to be paramount: an experimental basis.

H. L. C. Jaffé claims in his book "De Stijl" that the rupture between Mondrian and Van Doesburg was caused by the introduction of the experimental method into the latter's system in 1923. He cites in this regard a declaration by Van Doesburg, Van Eesteren and Rietveld: "Through our collective work, we have examined architecture as a plastic unity of all the arts and this conclusion must lead to a new style. We have examined the laws of space (..) and we have found that all variations of space can be governed as a balanced unity." But to examine and to find is empiricism, and their conclusion about the appearance of a new style is directly anti-experimental. Gropius's refusal to accept this prophecy, on the contrary, is clearly founded on an experimental conception of stylistic development. This does not, however, prevent Van Doesburg's spiritual dynamism from having been able to lead him to a genuine experimental conception of stylistics, had Gropius offered collaboration on this subject at the former Bauhaus instead of refusing all discussion of this problem. But all developments require time, and the time that has passed since the founding of the "International of Experimental Artists," of "Cobra," has not yet made opinion more clearly favourable to a discussion on this subject.
At the same time that the "Cobra" group was striving to reach the experimental stage of art, a group and almost an artistic climate was emerging in Paris, especially in the literary and cinematic domain, fully elaborating an experimental semantics, under the name of Lettrism. It is significant that in our era, so avid for the slightest false novelties, this upheaval — which took place by excluding the word art from the vocabulary and replacing it with experimental action — could have passed without anyone ever considering its importance.
The behavioural disturbances of Saint-Germain-des-Prés were judged as reckless excesses, without anyone realising that such a fermentation cannot end without something happening.

## Asger Jorn: Intimate Banalities

*Taste is something you inherit.*  
*The hyena lives a very ugly life.*  
Johannes Holbek

It is typical of those who have lost touch with what is fundamental in art to have also lost the sense of what is banal. By this I do not mean the ability to see banality, an ability which on the contrary develops in a morbid way. I mean the ability to understand the artistic value of banality, its paramount importance for art. There exists a multitude of anonymous banalities whose relevance extends over centuries and which surpass all the ingenious achievements of our so-called great personalities. Upon closer examination, one realises that the merit of these personalities is precisely their ability to grasp banalities.

The grandiose work of art is the perfect banality. And what most banalities lack is not being sufficiently banal — not being infinite in their depth and their logic — resting upon a dead foundation of spiritualism and aesthetics.
What is called the natural is liberated banality, the common or the obvious, without anyone having tried to mark it with the stamp of rarity. It is important to emphasise that the foundation of art rests upon the perpetually common, the easy and the cheap, which in reality turn out to be our dearest and most indispensable possessions.

It is only in Paris that one can find so much bad taste, and that is precisely the reason why it is the place where the inspiration of art still lives.

There is, for example, also a direct symbolic force in the words

Say it  
with flowers

which makes this poem one of the pillars of Danish lyric poetry. This poem is like a worn-out boot, of very fine craftsmanship, and in the musical domain, it can only be compared to amateur orchestras that play out of tune.

One of the greatest musical feats of today is being able to play out of tune. Musical renewal is sought in the barrel organ and cheap gramophones, which are its foundation.

My most beautiful musical experience took place in a small provincial town where the locals had suddenly been seized by an absolutely captivating desire to play on little enchanted celluloid flutes. One was as if bewitched by this little instrument that could emit thin, piercing trills, ascending and descending. People played them everywhere in the town, day and night, and only that — ascending and descending trills. Every boy, every girl, the men and the women, and even the venerable old men of the town had, hidden in their pocket, a little Pan flute which they would take out when they thought they were alone, to drink in a few trills of this captivating marvel. Those whose inner fibres had snapped suffered from this noise to which they remained strangers. Letters were sent to the newspapers and speeches were made to fight against the "racket" as it was called — but in vain.

It was only from the moment when influential inhabitants of the town got the police to intervene against those who were spreading disorder, to ban the sale of the flutes and to arrest all those found in possession of the notorious little celluloid apparatus, that the great anxiety, once more, very slowly, took hold again of the population of the small town. One could then return to the normal depressions so precious for the calm and serenity of society.

I have many witnesses who could vouch for the truthfulness of this event, but as far as I know, no one has yet examined its causes.

Jens August Schade seems to me to be the only Danish poet who truly grasps the elementary values created and exploited by man in banality. The only one who, in a consistent manner, founds his art on this vital substance and who manages to liberate it so well that his poetry continues to grow while renewing itself from within through repeated use — like the tales of Hans Christian Andersen.

Those who try to fight against the production of beautiful, daubed, polished paintings are the enemies of the best art today. Those lakes in the forests and those bellowing stags in a thousand living rooms hung with brown wallpaper with gold trim represent one of the deepest sources of artistic inspiration, and it is always a bit tiring to see people toiling to saw off the branch on which they are sitting.

The children who love picture cards and who paste them in books bearing the inscription

ALBUM

give more hope to artists than do various art critics and museum directors. One hears many schoolteachers complain about the fact that children, when they reach the age of twelve, stop making beautiful drawings. They should on the contrary rejoice in this development, for it is a condition of man's coming to awareness. I wanted to try to present the cheap things that nourish art. The cheap things are the things of the *lowest country* which has been described by Gustaf Munch-Petersen, and I do not wish to refrain from reproducing this poem as it is:

oh the immense happiness  
the immense happiness that those have had  
who were born in the lowest country —  
everywhere you see them  
who walk  
who love each other  
who weep  
they are everywhere  
but  
in their hands  
they carry the little things  
that come from the lowest country —  
— — —

oh greater than all countries  
more exquisite than all  
is the lowest country —  
in the heights  
the earth transforms itself into a lance —  
and below  
the heavy and living blood  
sinks and penetrates  
into the lowest country  
— — —

small cautious feet  
slender limbs  
and the air is pure  
on the ascending paths —  
among those who were born under the sky  
in closed arteries  
burns the longing —

oh you should  
you should go to the lowest country — !  
oh you should  
you should see the people  
of the lowest country  
where the blood flows between all —  
men —  
women —  
children —  
where joy and despair and love  
heavy and ripe  
cast their multicoloured fires upon the earth —  
oh earth that is as secret as a brow  
in the lowest country —  
— — —

everywhere you see them  
who walk  
who love each other  
who weep —  
their faces are closed  
and on the inner side of their soul  
there is earth  
earth from the lowest country

If one tries to understand the situation of art today, one must also try to understand the conditions that have determined the evolution of our intuition of art and our notion of its relationship to man and to society. The artist actively participates in the struggle to deepen this knowledge that is ours of our vital foundation, the foundation that for him makes artistic creation possible. The artist's zone of interest cannot, however, be limited to this domain alone; he must seek *the ultimate awareness* of the whole and of its details. Nothing is sacred to him, for everything has become important to him.

It can in no way be a matter of a choice but rather of penetrating into the entire cosmic system of laws that govern the rhythms, the energies and the substance that make up the reality of the world, and this from the ugliest to the most beautiful, everything that has character and expression, whether the coarsest and the most brutal or the finest and the most tender, everything that speaks to us because it is life itself.
And to express everything one must know everything.

The aesthetic principle is abolished. We are not disillusioned because we have no illusions. We have never had any.

What we possess, and what represents our strength, is that life fills us with joy, that life in all its amoral aspects awakens our interest. And this too is what represents the foundation of art today. We do not even know the laws of aesthetics, and this old idea that one has of choosing according to a principle of the Beautiful and the Ugly, as being what is noble or unworthy on the ethical plane, is dead for us, we for whom the Beautiful is ugly too and for whom everything that is ugly also possesses Beauty.

Behind comedy and tragedy, we find only the dramas of life which bind one to the other, not noble heroes and perfidious villains but simply men.

We know that whoever reads detective stories is reading something about himself. There are no beautiful dances and beautiful gestures, only expression exists, and what is called beautiful is merely the expression of *something*. Our music is not unaesthetic because it has nothing to do with the notion of aesthetics. We do not recognise the existence of architecture. There are only houses and sculptures. Machines for living and enormous sculpture. The Cathedral of Cologne is nothing but an empty magical sculpture whose purpose is purely psychological — whereas a glass of beer, that is architecture.

There do not exist different styles and they have never existed. Style is the expression of a bourgeois content and what one calls taste is its various shades.

The absolute distinction between sculpture and painting does not exist. No artistic expression can be isolated on the basis of its form, for it is solely a matter of different means that are employed toward a common artistic goal. Sandpaper and cotton wool are means of expression every bit as noble and every bit as usable as oil paint and marble. These are lines of orientation aimed at settling the account with the bourgeois conception of art.

It is banal to want to be done with idealism as a philosophy, but this also touches upon something central in art, namely its vital content itself.

What must be understood is that it is impossible to distinguish between the form of a painting and its content. The structure of the flower is given to it by its inner tension (it wilts when it loses its sap), and the same is true for art. It is the content that creates its tension. *Form and content are of an identical nature.* Form is the vital phenomenon and content is the living picture.

The content of the painting reflects what the painter contains. It reveals what he has been able to sense of himself and of his time, what he has been able to apprehend through the mind and the heart. It reveals the depth of his experience.

We cannot inherit from the preceding generation either a conception of life or a conception of art that is unchanging or constant. Artistic expression changes with the epochs, just as our experiences do, and a new experience creates a new form.

We are willing to learn everything that preceding generations can teach us, but we are the masters of deciding *our* needs ourselves. No one can make the choice for us. It is not our duty to receive the legacy of the preceding generation and to shape it according to their desire. It is on the contrary their duty to help us where we need help.

The problem that is treated here tentatively is of such an intimate nature that every man is concerned. No one can strip it of his individuality. *The spectator does not exist and cannot exist today.*

## Troels Andersen: The Collections of Asger Jorn in Silkeborg

The collections of Asger Jorn at the Silkeborg Museum of Art date back to 1953. He was working at that time in a small ceramics workshop in the village of Sorring near Silkeborg. The museum had paid the ceramics workshop a modest sum for covering Jorn's expenses and obtained in exchange the right to select a certain number of works when they were completed. On the occasion of this purchase, Jorn gave some drawings, etchings and lithographs. He then promised that in the future he would donate his own works to the museum and that he would also hand over the gifts given to him by his friends.

In 1958, Jorn began systematically collecting the works of his contemporaries in Europe and of artists whose work represented a source of inspiration for him. Towards the end of that year the exhibition "New International Art" opened, with about a hundred works.
In his introduction, Jorn expressed some of the ideas he had concerning these collections, whose expansion and choice of subjects are unique in Europe. He was not seeking to create "a general survey of the most modern art, nor a collection of precious masterpieces, but for the most part inexpensive graphic works, and only a few rare works are among the foremost. This small collection is intended rather as a provocation than as an expression of my gratitude towards Danish artistic life. How and why is a question to which each person interested in art in Scandinavia must answer for themselves.

The pieces in a museum are souvenirs, and in my opinion, these belong to my era. Time will tell whether they are something other, and more, than souvenirs. It was Frederik Dam who gave me my first, indelible impression of grandeur in modern Danish art. There I saw my universe. That was in Silkeborg in 1933. (-) For as long as he lived, he was my art dealer. It was he who, in 1938, organised my first exhibition, together with the French painter Pierre Wemaëre.

During one of my many financial crises, he took charge of the Fernand Léger canvases, exhibited here, which my master had given me. Léger had given me some gouaches that I intended to reproduce in "Politikens Magasin," accompanied by a description of the work carried out for Léger's large canvas "Le transport des Forces," intended for the Palais de la Découverte for the International Exhibition of 1937. They were never reproduced and it proved impossible to sell them despite the warmest recommendations from Lundstrøm and Poul Henningsen. Later they disappeared.

The canvases that Dam had taken charge of were not intended for reproduction. They were not even signed because Léger did not like them. He gave them to me one day when I had nothing to paint on and he himself was apparently penniless. Back home, I was unable to use them as canvas. I found them too good.

It was Léger, incidentally, who gave me Franz Kafka's novel "The Castle" and that is how I discovered this great literary work, which would not exist today if Kafka's friend, Max Brod, had followed his instructions and burned the manuscripts. It is difficult to find two ways of understanding art that are as far apart from each other as that of Fernand Léger and that which characterised pupils like Pierre Wemaëre and myself. What Léger despised and fought against through his canvases — the tonality of colours, the purity of the material, and the personal character of the brushstroke, everything that he detested like the plague and eliminated whenever he could — all of this was the basis of my artistic form. Is it so strange that what I love most in Léger's canvases is what he himself did not like? Many connoisseurs share my opinion, incidentally. But perhaps it is a sign of the times. For Léger, the act of painting a canvas represented a mechanical process that could perfectly well be executed by a disciple, provided, of course, that he was very disciplined. But when my own needs exceeded the framework of training, he relentlessly heaped abuse upon me. This classic use of disciples fitted perfectly with his conception of an artist's social work. Although anti-religious, he had to carry out good works for the church. I have gradually acquired the deepest respect for his artistic conduct, even though it is different from my own. I learned nothing from Léger's teaching, but his personality marked me definitively as an artist, and to explain this represents for me the most natural introduction to an exhibition of that part of modern art which has been important to me."

A series of exhibitions followed during the 1960s in Silkeborg, all organised by Jorn. He concentrated on the engravings and lithographs of his contemporaries. This led to exhibitions comprising almost complete collections of the engraved work of Jean Dubuffet (1961 and 1965), Alechinsky (1964), and Matta (1969). To these must be added more than a hundred drawings and watercolours by Henri Michaux (1962), paintings and drawings by Pierre Wemaëre (1963) and the Danish Symbolist painter Johannes Holbek (1965). Jorn also regularly sent his own canvases, drawings, ceramics and engravings, and in 1964, on the occasion of the latter's fiftieth anniversary, the museum organised an exhibition of all the works donated by Jorn up to that point. In 1968, Jorn donated his masterpiece "Stalingrad" to the museum. Several of his gifts have, however, an intimate character; they are often small canvases, improvisations and sketches. Jorn by no means wished to dominate the collection. He explained the purpose of these donations in a letter addressed to the museum in 1961: "I could have borrowed more interesting works from Dubuffet and others. But I have established the principle that the museum will never exhibit anything other than the works it owns. We already have Louisiana and the Modern Museum in Stockholm which organise exhibitions with the aim of keeping people informed of new tendencies. I wish to cooperate with the museum of Silkeborg, because that is where I can make the public understand what I love and what I find, for the moment, important; not because I wish to be a judge in matters of art and quality, but simply to show what a particular and limited group considers to be important."

The museum presents spontaneous-abstract art from its origins and its evolution. Jorn takes his starting point in the figure compositions of the 18th century and sweeps over the 19th to arrive at the Symbolists: Redon, Ensor and Kubin. German Expressionism is represented by, among others, Max Beckmann, Corinth, Dix and Nolde. Symbolism and Expressionism were, according to Jorn, the foundations of spontaneous-abstract art. The works of Man Ray, Jean Arp, Picabia and Max Ernst underline the importance of the Surrealist influence on Danish art. From there, Jorn follows his own era and the artistic groups in which he himself exerts an influence: first Danish painting before and during the war, then the ramifications of this painting on the post-war European scene with Cobra, and the circle of artists gathered in Italy around the ceramics workshops in Albisola during the 1950s. According to Jorn, Wols and Pollock marked, during this period, the extreme limits of the development of painting: the donation includes almost all of Wols's engravings.

In the last years, Jorn added works by the Cuban painter Feijoo and a collection of Japanese kites. In this "art brut" or in the art of "intimate banalities," seen as a whole, one finds the last perspective that he managed to present to the museum of Silkeborg.

## Erik Nyholm: Have Fun

When in March 1976 Jean Dubuffet gave his approval for the construction of a 100 m² ceramic wall, intended for the Silkeborg Museum of Art, the realisation of the project was immediately envisaged.

It was preferably not to be postponed too long, and it was necessary to spend as little as possible, while still carrying out solid work.

On the basis of experience I had already gained, I proposed that we work with prefabricated square kiln shelves of at least 40 cm. The design could be projected directly onto them, drawn on them, painted with enamel, and the tiles fired (at 1280–1300°) stacked on top of one another and separated by trivets. This process, carried out in a single firing, would be efficient in every respect, and the finished product would be particularly durable.

There was little information about how Dubuffet had envisaged the realisation of this project (originally intended for the University of Nanterre). There were black-and-white photographs of various preparatory works and various tests, carried out by the French ceramicists who had worked for Dubuffet, which appeared to be made of square surfaces without much relief effect.

I left for Norway to see the original sketch, which made a vivid impression on me. It was painted in a coarse painting technique in several layers, which inspired one to reproduce it in ceramics.

The study of the sketch confirmed the plan I had of executing the relief in high-fired ceramics. The perfectly matte surface of the ceramic responded well to Dubuffet's sketch and was a material I knew well.

There were several red colours and a very pronounced yellow in the sketch, and the question was whether these colours would survive firing at high temperatures. In most large ceramic works that require very pronounced colours, the colour enamels are fired at a temperature lower than that required for the tile, which has been fired beforehand. These colours are often glossy enamels that would not harmonise with the motif and, moreover, would only complicate a deliberately simplified working method.

With colour "stains" from the firm "Ferro," I carried out some tests of enamels in red and yellow, and I discovered that some, made from a mixture of enamel and wood ash, retained their colour at 1300°. As far as the red-striped surfaces were concerned, the pink was not ideal, but I tried to counterbalance it with a particular ultramarine blue in the blue stripes. The grey and grey-pink surfaces were the most substantial surfaces of the sketch; sand and refractory clay were mixed into the enamel there.

After some kiln tests, I produced a part of the relief, approximately 2 m² — 12 tiles stacked on top of one another and separated by small trivets.

The result was such that we thought it could at least serve as a basis for the practical negotiations concerning the final realisation of the relief.

We left for Paris with 100 kg of ceramics as luggage. How the meeting with Dubuffet would end was quite uncertain. During the preliminary work on this sample, I had been obliged to take certain liberties with the original sketch (which was still hanging in Oslo). When one must transform a painted sketch into a ceramic piece ten times larger, it is necessary to interpret and improvise somewhat, among other things to meet technical requirements.

I felt that Dubuffet's mark was clearly recognisable in the sample — and Dubuffet was of the same opinion. He gave me carte blanche for the realisation of the relief and wished us: "Have fun!"

The firing of approximately 600 tiles had to take place in a workshop larger than my own. There too, we were fortunate. Two young ceramicists, whom I had known for several years, Esben Lyngså Madsen and Bent Skytte Rasmussen, built a ceramics workshop in Lund in Jutland in the autumn, 20 km from where I live. They had built an improved model of gas kiln that was very suitable for such an operation, and the capacity of their workshop was ideal.

Jorn produced his ceramic relief for the secondary school in Aarhus in 1959. He had to go abroad to carry out this very large work himself. Dubuffet left us free to produce his large wall in Denmark, and he left us free to transpose his sketch onto a different material. It was a gift — and at the same time it represented a provocation for Danish craftsmanship. The provocation was accepted, in the hope that Dubuffet's greatness would conceal the worst of our mistakes.

The work itself was not undertaken until June 1977. It proved to be far more thorny than the tests had suggested. The projection presented greater irregularities than we had anticipated, and we were obliged to tighten the drawing according to the sketch — Dubuffet's touch had to come through in all its power and intact — that was the condition. It also turned out that the colours and textures of the enamels changed when working on an area of more than 100 m². What was to be done?

I had been given the freedom to "have fun," but with freedom came responsibility and, with it, doubt. Serious reservations had to be made, and from these very conditions, the work took on the character of a grand experiment.

This experiment came to an end in September 1977, and the relief now awaits taking its place on the building that is to house Jorn's collections in Silkeborg.
