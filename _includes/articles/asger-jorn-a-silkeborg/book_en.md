## Prelude with Fine Herbs (Prélude aux fines herbes)

O my little nothing pretty little nothing  
I love nothing better then my life.  
I have nothing.  
I can spend nothing.  
and I take nothing  
home to my wife.

("Airy Nothing" in the English style) (« Air de rien » à l'anglaise)

[*Translator's note: "Air de rien" is a French expression meaning "nonchalantly" or "as if it were nothing," but here it puns on "air" as a musical piece and "rien" (nothing).*]

### Homage American-Style (Hommage à l'Americaine)

The book you are about to savor here on the cuisine of tongues is the first of its kind. This surprising fact finds its explanation in the obstacle, until now insurmountable, posed by the cultletic (cultelique) enigma of personality. Strictly personal, this book obviously does not exist, since by definition what does not exist is no one and no one can exist at the present hour.

Yet the dazzling progress of the new scientific zeromorphy (zéromorphie) has allowed us to re-stitch this delicate problem thanks to the implementation of a largely computain (computaine) nought-technique (néan-technique), necessary for the glutosonorous struction (struction glutosonore) of our ethnogastric dia-march (dia-marche ethnogastrique).

Having thus amply satisfied our auditory thirst at the good springs flowing from the lost source, fortunately rediscovered by the men of science of today, we seized the occasion to draw from first-growth sources already stewed (cuitées) of the art of tomorrow.

We can only imprint our most vivid recognition and gratitude toward all those who have shown a gracious mythophonic (mythophonique) attitude, and moreover gratuitous, of a savorously poetic, human, and learned fecundity.

We excrethank (remerdions) most particulinarily (particulinairement) the Gotiska Gastrophilselskabets Generalurskottet of Stockholm, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, the Cave Coopérative de Vinification of Labastide-de-Lévis (Tarn), the Department of Culinary Arts of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the W.Z.T.X. of Cambera, Messrs. Flop-Goose and Striker (Le Bide-Oie et Gréviste), the Genièvre of Wambrechies, the M.P. of Naples, the Autonomous Guild of Radical-Socialist Cooks of Guadeloupe, the D.D.T. of Lausanne, and above all Doctor Umberto Gambetta, Postman of Letters (Facteur ès Lettres) and holder of the Chair of Barcelettology (Barcelettologie) at the Charred University of Albisola (Université Brucciato d'Albisola), who kindly authorized us to peruse his rich collections of popular legends of oral tradition. We deplore that the F.N.C.O.P. of Chicago refused its collaboration, for motives that science, as much as morality, condemns. Most fortunately, the Pomiane College of Nebraska compensated — and beyond — for this inexplicable failure.

### Smoked Sermon (Sermon fumé)

The Science of Culiphonic Potmyths (Marmythes culiphoniques), such could have been the title of this book, had we not been brought back to more modest ambitions by the amply justified feeling that, on the voice we are trying to open, all or almost all remains to be said, before one has the right to speak of true potmyths (marmythes). Indeed, if, as we hope, the homocony (homoconie) on the birth of man scores here a few smoking points, these are attached to nothing other than a resolute attitude of the illuminated before the obscure object which, for the first time perhaps, authorizes us to consider the potmyths from a completely chromic point of view.

The pfuisical (pfuisiques) sciences of our era evolve arbitrarily among the knowledge of the works of a Nature which, according to scientists, no longer exists. Man himself and his tongue must unquestionably pass to the same potmyth (marmythe) and be served one day as an object of scientific knowledge, they too. This knowledge will ineluctably demonstrate the power of freedom in the arbitrary games of the mind, which makes man a tongue and the tongue, so to speak, a man, which is merely a way of speaking and making oneself interesting, as one can always claim that the art of today remains the future anterior to the present infinitive of the science of today.


## Gastrophonic Overture (Ouverture gastrophonique)

If a lump of soot falls into the soup, and it is not convenient to remove it, mix it well; this will give it a high French taste.

Jonathan Swift,  
Directions to Servants.

### Brass Soup (Soupe au laiton)

The brilliant master chef Escoffier never failed, in his lofty lessons, to mention and deplore the disappearance of the human tongue.

Invented thousands of years ago, the human tongue has not existed for twenty centuries, except perhaps as a folkloric curiosity in a few ethnic groups isolated from modern civilization.

Granted that man himself is of quite recent invention, since he dates from the great French Revolution, it is interesting to observe that the human tongue had disappeared several millennia before the whole man became the main course (plat de résistance). One distinguishes here one of those multiple contradictions between nature and culture that characterize culinary science.

We can only imagine what the human tongue was like, cooked in a thousand savory ways. We nonetheless remain at point zero of the human tongue, which is, after all, quite encouraging since a zero tongue has precisely the proper function of opposing the absence of tongue. The infinity of repeating zeros makes the tongue possible. Provided one is not too greedy, one can already, for the moment, be content with half-portions. It is not meta-tongues that are lacking.

Nowadays, while man is in the process of disappearing, the nomic absence of his tongue is increasingly felt, especially in the kitchen where the absence of human tongues portends the worst catastrophes, since a languid cuisine (cuisine alanguie) is not cuisine: it is a failure, from the culinary as much as the stronomic point of view.

This *gastronomic* book is written to prevent such a disaster by putting the tongue back in its *astronomic* place, that is to say visual, as the very foundation of cuisine.

A cuisine that is not founded on the tongue and does not melt on the tongue does not fall under the gustatory code of structuralinguistic anthropophagy.

### Sonhorrific Potage (Potage sonhorrifique)

With culitonic linguistation (linguistation culitonique), we have — as we have specified — passed into the void, which requires an implicated explanation of the avid evidence antagonizing beneath the evident avidity of glossorial vidomorphy (vidomorphie glossorielle).

Here we rely on the mythification of the exhaustive nullogical nothingismogenesis (néantismogenèse nullogique), expounded by the eminent videologist Thomas v. Lectern (Lehrstuhl), of the University of Nothingheim (Nichtenheim) in his great work (13 volumes): *Eine kleine Nichtigkeit* ("A Little Nothing") where, in passing (vol. VI, pp. 179 ff.), he passes to the past of the ancient antithesis to arrive at the future of the futhesis (futèse), logically teleguided by what was anterior to the antithesis, today demodern (démoderne).

[*Translator's note: The German "Lehrstuhl" means "professorial chair," and "Nichtenheim" is a play on "nichts" (nothing). The work's title means "A Little Nothing" in German.*]

Through a dividual diavision, he establishes the absolute identity between the void as being and vision as vidic becoming. Thus the futurist becoming of glossorial visionibility belongs to what was, and the late good cuisine is a myth, which, in the culinographic aspect, identifies myth with fire since fire was fire and good cuisine was. This clarification founds the basic diastructure, vidicle (vidicule) of our mythogastric futhesis (futèse mythogastrique).

After this elastic diapassment (diapassement) of visionary fire into the void, envided (envidé) by an auditive and vidiphile vision, we can henceforth install ourselves in the triple scholastic signividence, that of the void, in itself vidu, of vidence, in itself dense, and of the bouncer (videur), in itself emptied (vidé), encompassed by evidence divided by the void-air (vidair) (Ger.: *lehrer*).

[*Translator's note: "Lehrer" means "teacher" in German, playing on the French "vide" (empty/void) and related words.*]

### Trombone in brodo

The schoolarized happiology (heureusologie scolairisée) of futetic futuration implies an inevitable etrological problematism for the glossoculinary diamarch (diamarche glossoculinaire). Its etronomic nullity applies neither to the cultificial (cultificiel) nor to the naturafficial (naturafficiel) since, artificial, the glossificassity (glossificassité) of its gastrous naturalization concludes with the culination of its national cultstructability (culstructabilité) which finds its originality in the logical formula *qui-sine, qua-non.*

[*Translator's note: A play on the Latin phrase "sine qua non" (without which not), here rendered as "who-without, which-not" while punning on "cuisine."*]

A new determythic determinometry (détermométrie détermythique) recently unearthed by diathermostatistical computology reveals here a movement going from bad to worse — in pyrometric terms — toward the denatured, therefore artificial, decult.

### Rigaudon with Rotgut (Rigaudon au tord-boyau)

This disastrological dramatomorphy (dramatomorphie désastrologique) emanates more precisely from the immanuel bad toward the transcendied worse which is the transpiration of expired inspiration, as the formula to be descarted would have it: "I think, therefore I sweat" (« Je pense, donc je sue »).

[*Translator's note: A play on Descartes' "Je pense, donc je suis" (I think, therefore I am), with "suis" replaced by "sue" (sweat). "Descarter" plays on both Descartes and "écarter" (to discard).*]

Having descarted all that smells of soot, we can immediately consecrify our major force, whole and blood-sweating (sangsueur), to the blood-sausagesonorous (sangsaucissonore), harmonimetric and assaucial paradisology of the defuted (défutées) possessed by illusive happionomy (heureusonomie id~~llusive), which permits us to undertake our tachism with an optimysticism largely pissimissible, underpinned by the Hellenic myth recalled by Tonplat in his dialogue on the origin of pissimism:

[*Translator's note: "Tonplat" is a play on "Platon" (Plato), with "ton" (tone) and "plat" (dish/flat).*]

**Mm 1**

*Agamemnon and Alcibiades are strolling and conversing in the courtyard of the gymnasium in the shade of the nearby cypresses. Point-blank, Agamemnon asks his companion: "Alcibiades my friend, might you not be a spiritist by chance?" To which Alcibiades responds with another question: "Why is that?"*

*"Because," replies Agamemnon, "you reek strongly of spirits."*

*This spirited remark was the object of a long suite of meditations and reflections. After which, Alcibiades asked his companion: "Agamemnon my friend, might you not by chance be a pissimist?"*

[*Translator's note: The dialogue plays on "spiritiste" (spiritist), "spiritueux" (spirits/alcohol), and "spirituel" (witty), as well as "pessimiste" (pessimist) and "pisser" (to piss).*]

It is difficult to analyze this myth because of the triple uncertainty that reigns here regarding the transludic visageness (dévisagesse transludique) of the dialogue in the templar wood of the two classical heroes. Although they are spectral spirites with a spirituous aspectre, one nonetheless recognizes in them beings of a purely olfactive versionomy.

### Chiantinata

But there is more. The spectrological olfaction of the liquid boozery (boissonnerie) of the gymnasticular cypressions at *point-blank* (consequently set on fire and reduced to ashes) releases, in a definitivefervent (définitifervente) manner, the stench of the spectroculinary heroes of putrescent (pourrielle) cruelty, by connecting precisely the corpuscular odoromy (odoronomie) to the boirocratic bender (cuite boirocratique), founded on the bottled (boitelle) linguophagy of limping (boiteuses) bottles that are at the very base of *firewater* (therefore of the burning drink by which one warms oneself), as is mentioned in several potmyths (marmythes) of a rather nebulous transparenty (transparenté) on the exstatistical origin of the compenetrating drunkensemblance (ivressemblance) of the alcoholastic spirit among the hyperbucolical savages.

[*Translator's note: Extensive wordplay on "boire" (to drink), "boisson" (drink), "boiter" (to limp), and "bouteille" (bottle).*]

The butological busivation (busivation butologique), in contrastructuration to abusive debutation, brings us to the goal (but) of our effort, when we have drunk enough (bu). As the spiritist has drunk (bu), abuse belongs to the realm of the spirit. It is there that the disbutants end up butting against one another through fission of embeveragement (emboissonnement). It is clear and simple.

We have thus established that, through olfactomorphic codings, the same impertinent opposition expresses itself, of a culinary nature, between the boozery of a bender and the licked-clean crustacean. Subsequently and above all — given that we have an additional proof in support of our interpretations — we shall establish that there also exist proofs, in the stinkological (puanthologique) domain, of the existence of a methodorative incertificate which requires that we confine ourselves, for the moment, to the underlignification of the transpiromorphic aspect of the volatile emanations that we shall devulgarize with modesty in the following pages.


## Sonata in Sole Meunière (Sonate en sole meunière)

Auf seinen Nasen schreitet  
einher das Nasobem  
von seinem Kind begleitet.  
Es steht noch nicht im Brehm.

Es steht noch nicht im Meyer,  
und auch im Brockhaus nicht.  
Es trat aus meiner Leyer  
zum ersten Mal ans Licht.

Auf seinen Nasen schreitet  
(wie schon gesagt) seitdem,  
von seinen Kind begleitet,  
einher das Nasobem.

[*Translation from German: "Upon its noses strides / along the Nasobame / accompanied by its child. / It's not yet in Brehm. // It's not yet in Meyer, / nor in Brockhaus either. / It stepped out of my lyre / for the first time into light. // Upon its noses strides / (as already said) since then, / accompanied by its child, / along the Nasobame." — This is Christian Morgenstern's famous nonsense poem about an imaginary creature that walks on its noses. Brehm, Meyer, and Brockhaus are German encyclopedias.*]

### Cucumber Lectern (Pupitre à concombres)

Contrary to all pissimistic previsions, we have succeeded in discovering two savage tribes that highly appreciate the tongue and seek it with ardor. These tribes are established on two adjoining domains, within the Parisian agglomeration; the first of these domains is called Montparnasse and the other the XIVth arrondissement. It is there that we gathered the basic data for our memoir on the raw and stewed tongue (la langue crue et cuite), its myths and its rites. For convenience of exposition, we shall henceforth designate the Montparnasse tribe by M and the tribe of the XIVth arrondissement by 14 A.

The metric geographology that determs the diametronomic doublure of the two tribes studied establishes the distincture of their situlogement (situational lodging), following a distinctly spacimorphic and superficile method. This fact of evidence does not prevent the two tribes from trying to make up stories (faire des histoires), abusive and undrinkable, about what happened to them in the past.

We do not want any stories! And the liberties thus taken with a mythic text often create troublesome stories, a myth being perfectly capable of contradicting the ethnogastric reality to which it claims to refer. This distortion — which is part of its structure — is always scrambled by dismythic historiation (histoiration dismythique) which, by that very fact, must be excluded.

The reason why we dismyth the mythologies of M and 14 A is confirmed by the comparison of the stories that occurred because of the stories that the two tribes claim to be their myths of origin, but which are in reality only dismyths.

The dismyth on the origin of tribe M affirms:

**Dm 1**

*It is pure chance that our tribe localized in Montparnasse. Originally, it was migratory, without stable stationing. The annals of the Roman legion called us the GLUTTONNIC tribe, and we were greatly feared, even beyond measure, because of our fabulous courage. We were merely very peaceful warriors and burglars.*

It is patent that the chromonotonies of these annalistic stories are in no way mythic, which illuminates the comparison with the delyrious stories of tribe 14 A regarding its origin:

**Dm 2**

*Our tribe is of Alesiatical origin and occasionally sedentary in its moments of repose. Since its origin, it has been called the GLUG-GLUG tribe, and our greatest sacred festival — which lasted all year — consisted of the commemoration of the Taking of the Bottle, during which our people had, with fervor, endured the hard durations of the long siege (chaise = chair/siege) of Alésia. We have never been burglars, but on the contrary brave pillagers, neither courageous nor peaceful, but heroic and worthy of distrust.*

[*Translator's note: "Chaise" (chair) puns on "siège" (siege). Alésia was the site of Julius Caesar's famous siege against Vercingetorix.*]

There is a diasensical (diasensée) contradiction between these two dinamyths, a contradiction deepened by the claim of members of tribe M to a similituration between the gluttonnic tone and the glug-glug sound on one side, on the other between the culturomorphic tone and the naturomorphic sound. According to this theory, tribe M should be opposed to tribe 14 A.

It is in vain that a quantity of ethnologists have bent over this problem of the original relationship of the two tribes. Yet it is necessary to mention here the famous hyperthesis, widely discussed, ventured by the Italian sociologist Stained Veal (Vitello Macchiato), according to which the gluttonnic myth and the glug-glug myth were but a single holistic totality in tonic and bruitic diaversion, emanating originally from a single BRUITONNIC people. This proposition is so aberrant that it has the primary merit of eliding any extellectural commentary on its subject.

But the triplicity of the tributary abuse of these undrinkable dismyths surpasses the lack of archilogical struction of their stories, the oppositionals in question having seen nothing and understood nothing for the reason that they were clearly interburied (entéressés) in this frightful unilateral and enterrible confrontology.

[*Translator's note: "Entéressés" puns on "intéressés" (interested) and "enterrés" (buried).*]

Let us underline that for the success of our eminently scientific diamarch it is in our fundamental interest to remain entirely disinterested in conformity with the law that only non-interest can have interest since interest is without interest from the scientific point of view. Thus we are without interest, which
precisely allows us to be interested, by virtue of the culimorphic rule: "one cannot eat when one has eaten."

The occasion is thus offered to us to leap immediately upon eroticism which, with reason, impassions our readers and others.

### Omelet with Bugle in Heat (Omelette au bugle en chaleur)

The exciting structuration of sexual relations between the two groups M and 14 A rests on very precise rules. The men of tribe M go to seek women in tribe 14 A, which clearly reveals an exogamy, which is doubled by a bilateral approach since the men of tribe 14 A go to seek women from tribe M, whence the following schema:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-23.jpg)

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-22.jpg)

to which is added the fact that the men of tribe M do not forbid themselves from chasing the women of the same tribe M and that the women of said tribe M willingly go hunting for men of their own tribe M, which fits into the schema:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-24.jpg)

Similarly, the men of tribe 14 A run after the women of tribe 14 A and the women of tribe 14 A after the men of tribe 14 A, which is accounted for by the schema:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-25.jpg)

Thus the exogamy observed at the beginning of our work is doubled by a rather comfortable endogamy, which is defined by the schema:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-26.jpg)

It is frequent that men inhabiting sector 14 A spend most of their time in M. The same phenomenon is observed for women of 14 A. And the inverse case is not rare. It also happens that a man or a woman leaves sector 14 A and settles in M and vice versa, which implies a return to the abandoned tribe for erotic diversions.

Finally, an important rule we have been able to identify holds that, in a non-negligible number of cases, a man of tribe M, instead of running after a woman, runs after the behind of a man, whether from tribe M or tribe 14 A. It goes without saying that a man of tribe 14 A can act identically. The women of tribe M, like those of tribe 14 A, also take to running after women of M or 14 A. Thus the schema takes shape:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-29.jpg)

This schema is completed by a bilateral arrow to indicate the fact that two men or two women can seek each other reciprocally:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-30.jpg)

But it also occurs that a man *a* sets out hunting a man *b* who is hunting a woman *c*, whence the schema:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-31.jpg)

This woman *c* may be hunting a man *d*, himself hunting a woman *e*, and so on, which gives us the schema:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-33.jpg)

Of great frequency is the bilateral hunt, falsely defined as the erotomorphic triangle. Indeed, a man *a* can chase two women *b* and *c* at the same time:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-35.jpg)

These two women can for their part share their interest between two men, which gives us three men (*a*; *d*; *e*) and the schema:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-36.jpg)

This structure amplifies according to the number of men and women involved, such that one can sometimes figure it thus:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-37.jpg)

The famous erotomorphic triangle only closes if man *a* is attached to two women of whom one (*b*) or both (*b*, *c*) are lesbians, which gives the two triangles:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-38.jpg)

or again, in the hypothesis of two men (*a*, *d*) and a woman *b*, if one of the men (*a*) is a pederast and is impassioned for the other man *d* or if the two men are impassioned for each other and vice versa:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-40.jpg)

That a man *a* chases a woman *b* who chases a man *c* who chases a woman *d* does not exclude the hypothesis of woman *d* chasing man *a*. The result is a square circulation — wrongly judged impossible — which appears in the schema:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-41.jpg)

The plurality of hunters and the chaining of their volitions engender a circular structure known as the vicious circle:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-43.jpg)

The other combinations flowing from this severely structured system are easily foreseeable. Men and women who do not respect these rules of sexual relations are condemned to live in complete abstinence, unless they extend their hunting domain to outside the territories of the two tribes, which is normally done by nearly all the men and women of both tribes M and 14 A.

To contest the relation between this general view of the eroticism of M and 14 A and the raw and stewed tongue would be to manifest a total contempt for trifles and distractions.

### Salome in Slices (Salome en tranches)

It is only from the zoological and botanological domestication onward that the linguophonic diametry between the two tribes becomes noticeable. A zoodomestic myth of tribe 14 A partly illuminates us on the zoodomythology of the cockurial origin of gallonomy in the barnyard:

**Mm 2**

*A great rooster, very aged, is weary of his daily rounds which make him run after all the hens in increasing numbers and oblige him to considerable erotological and perpeturbative efforts. The owner of the barnyard, who is also himself a great runner out of breath, understands the situation, procures a young rooster of good breed and introduces him into the henhouse.*

*The old rooster appreciates the relief, salutes the young fervent one, and fraternally proposes to divide the lot into equal parts. Thus each would have his dose of pleasure. But the young rooster wants nothing to do with an equallistical compromise. He wants to be the poulistical dominator of the entire ensemble.*

*As there is no possibility of treason, the old rooster finds himself constrained to find a definitive solution to the problem and, regretfully, invites the young rooster to a sporting competition: "Since we are runners," he tells him, "we shall decide between us, by a race in the yard (course en cour), who shall have the empire of the barnyard (basse-cour). We shall run the course of the yard ten times in succession, and the fastest shall win." The young rooster, sure of his courageability, accepts immediately and does not even refuse to concede to the old rooster a few meters' head start, in consideration of his advanced age and his long tenure in the yard. Thereupon, they set off.*

*The owner follows the competition with interest, hoping to witness a real cockfight. The turn of events plunges him into beatific stupefaction. As for him a real rooster is essentially a chaser of hens, and not a chaser of roosters in a yard race, and as the young rooster, intent on his idea of catching up with the old rooster, totally loses interest in the hens, the owner withdraws all his esteem from his new boarder as he persists in his chase. And suddenly he emerges from his bewilderment, takes his rifle and, with a well-aimed shot, strikes him down before the latter has succeeded in demoralizing him and demoralizing the old rooster. "This is a bit much," exclaims the owner, "that's the third pederast rooster they've sold me!" Then the old rooster returns to his erotological labors, while deploring the impulsivation of immunological youth, expultant to the fact that there was enough for everyone.*

*After having henfully courted the entire yard, to the great henary satisfaction of the running henularity, the old rooster transforms himself into a courteous man and flies off into the feathers, slightly henristened by his fate, while the young rooster begins to boil with joy in his potmyth, with leeks and carrots.*

[*Translator's note: This passage contains extensive wordplay on "coq" (rooster), "cour" (yard/court), "courir" (to run), "course" (race), "poule" (hen), "courtois" (courteous), "faire la cour" (to court), etc.*]

This potmyth of tribe 14 A poses a problem we have not yet resolved: what meaning should be attached to the bizarre gallopade of these two gallantics in cockish coquetence (coquetence cocaire)? We shall not resolve it before having deepened the sensuality of the erotodox voice in the next chapter on the roast meunière. One must therefore arm oneself with a bit of patience.

If the rooster transforms, by metamorphosology, into a man, the contrary is obviously succeeded by Gallic bruitonomorphy (bruitonomorphie gauloiserielle). As one knows that a good rooster is necessary to make a good cockish cuisine (cuisine coculinaire), so too a good man is needed to play the rooster. This evidencery in no way taints the coquentinal aspect that will perspective our following inquestude.

### Roast Meunière (Rôt meunière)

Consequently, in a culture that gives itself over to erotomy, relations between man and woman take on an ambiguous and equivocal meaning. Considered in the raw state, every syntagmatic chain must be held to be deprived of meaning, either because no signification appears at first glance, or because one believes one perceives a meaning but without discerning whether this meaning is the right one. Insane erotomism has no sense. Yet erotomism must be sensed and sexualism understood and studied. To overcome this difficulty, we proceed to an erotomatic sensuration.

The sensomorphic problem is difficult to resolve. It imposes a structuration of sensational orientalization so as not to fall into occidental arbitrariness (arbitraire occidentel). One must also retain that the diasensual rules of consensual erotonymy are contrary to demented erotonomic de-sense, whereas the insanity of lied erotomorphy presents itself in the flow of a mathematico-logical sensibitionism elucidated in its positional variabilities by Van de Velde in his enculinary work *Tongue in 1,000 Ways* (*L'angue de 1.000 façons*).

[*Translator's note: "L'angue" puns on "la langue" (the tongue) and possibly "l'angle" (the angle). Van de Velde likely refers to Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde, author of works on sexuality.*]

These reservations made, we shall venture to suggest the immensionally sym-and-dia-bolic table, which follows:

### Rillettes Romeo (Rilettes Roméo)

After this methodotautological systematogenesis, we can resume with more security the comparison of the costumes named respectively primitive and traditional erotomism and natural and cultural erotomy. Let us not fear to look squarely at the difficulty we shall encounter subsequently when we butt against the poetico-artistic sense included in the mystical framework of sensorified mythology. Opposed to the reverse, the poetic sense is the sense of verse (sens des vers), extroverted as well as introverted, perverted as well as converted, and the notion of the verse sense (sens vers) where one must pour (verser) the verses thus forms a subject of contraversion.

How then to qualify the universal tongue? This is a problem over which we shall bend when we have the time. However, one must already logically distinguish the numerous universalities in polyversal transversalism. We note that the universe is unique and uniquely verse (vers), as the savage version of tribe 14 A would have it, while those of tribe M see in polyversality the unique universe into which one can pour (verser) the innumerable universes of earth, air, sea, etc.

Henceforth one understands the very precise sense that must be accorded to the sensual vocalism of the codachromatic verses. We return in this way to this diagrammatic confrontology. But it is necessary to examine in passing the question of rhinogradation nasobematic before concluding on unistrielle versificassity, by virtue of the glossopedantic approach on the tip of the tongue.

### Smoked Abelard (Abeilard fumé)

In the mythic version of the natives of 14 A, poetic sense is uniquely a question of the nose from which one pulls (draws) verses (worms). The gastrophonic auditure, inverse of this nasoid versionomy, has been excellently and sufficiently studied in the nasomorphological treatise on nasobemes entitled *Anatomy and Biology of the Rhinogrades* by Professor Dr. Harald Stümpke (Masson et Cie, publisher, 1962. Preface by P.P. Grassé, member of the Institut.) who has described, among numerous species, a lateral nasobeme and bilateral nasobemes discovered in the Aye-Aye-Aye archipelago (archipel des Aïeaïeaïe) a few years ago, but the existence of two specimens of these rhinogrades is attested in medieval France.

[*Translator's note: "Tirer les vers du nez" means "to worm information out of someone," literally "to pull the worms/verses from the nose." Stümpke's book is a famous scientific hoax about imaginary creatures.*]

The musiculinary specialty common to all nasobemes of the nasotonic species is their aptitude for playing the tongue on the cornet. The linguist cornet is nasobemed at the muzzle whose lips are formed such that it is perfectly bagpipe-musical (cornemusical) at the point of hearing (ouïe) — castrophilippe (lip, in English = *lipp*). This muzzle-morphic disparallelism engenders a problem that is hanging from the nose: that of handkerchief-tongues diapolarized according to whether they enter the nose or exit from it. We shall return to this subject another time.

### Red Herring Transistor (Hareng rouge transistor)

The tongue being lost, it is fitting to draw the consequences. According to the myth of tribe M, the tongue is a word, therefore a thing because a thing could not be a thing without being a word. According to myth 14 A, the tongue is on the contrary a thing, therefore a word. At once a social institution and a system of values, since it is the privileged organ of taste and contributes to swallowing and to speech, the tongue normally presents itself as a fleshy and mobile part suspended in the mouth.

Everything happens therefore as if words had at their disproportion no other choice than to signify things, or — on the contrary — as if things had at their disproportion no other choice than to signify words by incorporating them into their shady enterprises. The optative suspension between these two contradictionary solutions opens between the two tribes M and 14 A an abyss of words and things. It seems to us that this congenital enslavement of words to things or things to words within the suet-enterprise (entreprise seindoux) and targeted has artificially emprosified itself in reciprocosexual articulination at the level of a new neoplastic leveling.

In the opinion of verbalistic architheologists and avisual motologists, the thing first determines the word through articulination of the real, namely a first linguophonic level; then, the word determines the thing through symbolition of the real at the second glossonorous level where sown sensuality gives way to the sensible and piluloid technique of an intellectary sensibitionism. This is what is called the law of constructional urbanismology of the confused diffusion of the divisional fissionomies of lost time.

### Mute with Oil (Sourdine à l'huile)

The relation between tongue (langue) and language (langage) merits examination. The tongue is the language minus speech. To release the tongue, there is thus a necessity to cut off its speech, which is obtained radically by cutting off the tongue entirely. This carnage of the tongue is called language. The operation itself is named languagement.

To make cuisine, it suffices to follow good recipes. Good recipe, good cuisine. That is all there is to it. Good things are made by means of good words. More than a simple observation, we are dealing here with the methodological recipe for the structuration of culinary recipes. Scientifically gastronomic cuisine is a spoken cuisine. One causes (cause) the recipe and one gorges oneself on it. Good cuisine is a myth. A good dinner is read aloud. Those who imagine a scriptuary menu sufficient are mistaken: it is but dead letter and non-edible. "Animals feed, man eats, only the man of wit knows how to eat." This knowledge suffices him as nourishment, since this knowledge plugs his ears. The oral butchery of the intellect is a primary element of cuisine. Indeed, the two participating ear-plugs (bouche-oreilles) establish a bilateral system indispensable to culinary structuration: they are simultaneously two (ear-mouths) and synchronically mouth and ears.

[*Translator's note: "Bouche-oreilles" plays on "bouche" (mouth/plug) and "oreilles" (ears), as well as "boucherie" (butchery).*]

"It is because a tongue supposes a suite of thoughts that animals have none," Buffon already said. The fact that animals have no tongue is, at first glance, a bit disconcerting for cuisine, but it is fitting to recall that "all tongues are at the measure of men," as Turgot attested, even if they are small. It is that all tongues in the world belong to man: a beef tongue or a cat's tongue, a bird's or a cod's tongue are, according to the myths, tongues that belong to man, therefore man's tongues that replace the tongue of man, already disappeared with man.

### Snakes Out of Season (Couleuvres hors saison)

Whatever the case may be, if good cuisine today is a myth out of sight, it is thanks to the scientifigized industrifricassity (industrifricassité scientifigée) that has known how to conserve it. The structist motophony of limping logic still reserves for us motomythic surprises of all the words that motorize the thing. All the funny things start up in motorized logomotion; it follows that the word manages to motorize things by their motive originality.

The victory of motological cuisine through the verbalistic lodgment of the motomotivated vocabulator by the commotional vocation of the nose for mustard offers us a new entrance to the mot-dit (word-said/cursed) daily dish in conformity with the rules of corbuscular motulations.

[*Translator's note: "Mot-dit" puns on "maudit" (cursed) and "mot dit" (word said).*]

It is to be retained that this motoculinary point of departure of cuismological science is marked by the Lessinguistic establishment of a laconic laoconnery in the motomythic hors d'oeuvre of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing: *Laocoon oder über die Grenzen der Malerei und Poesie* (Laocoon, or On the Limits of Painting and Poetry), Berlin, 1766.

### Crayfish with Nuts (Ecrevisses aux ecrous)

We can therefore advance, on a general accord, that it is causerie (chat) that effects effective cuisine. Potmythic and causal cuisine being infective, non-spoken cuisine is non-causal and defective. Thus going in a straight line from cause to bavardmatic (chattering) effect, we can note that there will never be effect without cause, which legitimates that cuisine be sacrileckified for the good affective cause of caused causine.

[*Translator's note: "Causerie" means conversation/chat, playing on "cause" (cause/to cause) and "cuisine."*]

Whatever the case may be, writing remains zero, and if one applies here its symboloid formulas to printing to vulgarize our thoughts, it is uniquely for the princely reason that they already exist in typography. Scientific bouphonology in its gastrophonic aspect is therefore, theoretically as well as practically, *logical*. It establishes symmetric diamensions and affirms itself conglomerationally participial to GENERAL GASTROLOGY, at the superailleur level of vicious gastrography, confirmational of the scientific logic of the tongue before the letter.

As cuisine is made to satisfy the tongue, the tongue is made to be cooked. A. Martinet, in his *Elements of Linguistics* expresses himself clearly on this subject: "A tongue is a tool whose organization reveals that it was formed through time to satisfy its ends and that it is its use for these ends that guarantees the perpetition of its functioning." Thus the tongue remains always an organ whose culinary utilization reveals the employonnary functioning, of a revealing finesse for temporal and secular satisfaction and that guarantees, through the gustatory code, a perpetual and transistorial succession that terminates the end of the tongue.

### New Raw Diafish (Nouveau diapoisson cru)

Modern man, who seeks the goal (but) of everything, knows that this goal is the tongue. He also knows that everything is done at the measure of the tongue, that all cuisine is languagement and that we live in a tongue-epoch (époque-langue).

If the contribution of Danish scholars to this holinguistic sympathesis is remarkable, we do not believe we underestimate their effort by calling attention to the ancient traditions of the Danish tongue which operates, since always, this identity by using the same word to express *language* (in Danish: *maal*), the *goal* (in Danish: *maal*), the measure (in Danish: *maal*) and the meal (in Danish: *maaltid*), as one observes in the untranslatable formula: "I vor tungemaaltid er vor maal at maale landets maal i maaltider." Which, in French, links the *dish* (culinary *mets*) to the method and to *metric* measure. It is a fine example to follow in the course of our next voyage to the end of the tongue.

[*Translator's note: The Danish phrase roughly means "In our tongue-meal it is our goal to measure the country's language in meals."*]

Thus we begin to understand that the tongue in itself is a cuisine because cuisine can only be a tongue, and the cuisine of the tongue a cuisine tongue.

### Frozen Pathétique (Pathétique surgelée)

Let us pause a moment on this conception of the tongue. Tribe M shares the conviction that a tongue is a tongue and that all tongues are tongues, whereas tribe 14 A claims that there exists only a single and same tongue named the tongue, or, better, the tongue of tongues. Each time the natives of tribe 14 A come upon a tongue, they exclaim: "Here is the tongue!" which presupposes that for tribe 14 A the tongue is multiple and polymorphic.

We touch here on two fundamental characters of linguistico-culinary thought. The tongue, held to be the sum of all existing tongues, would be there — and even a bit there — as soon as one had reunited all the tongues of the world in a single tongue. It would be a famous piece, but difficult to cook.

The savages of tribe M maintain on the contrary that this effort is useless and vain since the sum of all tongues is not different from a single one of the tongues, which does not prevent a tongue from being different from another tongue, and even from all the other tongues in the world. One infers from this that all tongues are a single tongue precisely by virtue of their linguistic differences.

One will kindly reflect a moment on this identical alterity which does not immediately enter into our demonstration but which it is useful nonetheless to elucidate in order to underline the central position the tongue occupies in the cuisine of tribes M and 14 A, by which our labor is justified.

### Klaxon Pâté (Pâté de klacson)

The establishment of a glotic community around a single universal tongue is of an individuctibly evidencible avortage. This requires the disposification of a recipuantor at the glossoculinary size of the unicooking (unicuisson) of a same individed tongue.

The productological ecology of a similar enterprise would be enormythic, since one would have to cook this tongue in one faith (une foi/une fois = one time). Fire being a myth poses no problem. It is exclusively the demographological distributation that is in question. But the transportability meanances and the exactitudic menstruations at the disposal of modern technocrassivity should, with facilitation, assure the portional receveration by each of a comestipulated glossary at the right moment and in the desired place.

It is therefore to be comprendified that the enthousiasmology with which tribe M celebrates the origin of the communitary cult of the glossiversal individual according to the ancient mythography correlative to all linguistophonic aspects remains incorromplative.

### Bacon of the Kidney (Lard du rein)

But here now the problem widens since we are confronted, by the mythomorphy of tribe 14 A, with other distinguative aspects of divisioned glossotonalities.

The inconvenienciation of the common and individual tongue advanced by tribe 14 A comes from the fact that this tongue is attached to a head, which supposes a single common and individual head universally glossephalomorphic and multicorpuscular, with this consequence that the numerous bodies must attach themselves, in cibuloid participhony, to the tongue of a communiary head. The biologorhythmic affortation of such a syntesticularity seemed insurmounterable. The compositional tentativations of a single head and common tongue to two or several bodies did not in fact know any appreciary and meritional successions. There is therefore weight in the prothesis objectivocabulated by the members of tribe 14 A.

But there is better. Although the universally individualistic tongue and head is economic, its nombrematic phrasomorphy is at the same time of an extreme languorous poverty in multitudological variabilition.

### Accordion Sausage (Andouille en accordéon)

The reader risks being disconcerted by this discussion on the unity and the divisional multiplicity of the tongue that passions the two examined tribes. We justify it by the project we have formed to treat the sequences of each sectioned tongue and the tongues themselves in their reciprocal relations as instrumental parts of a musiculinary work and to assimilate their study to that of a diaphonic symphony. To realize our objective, we therefore rely on the polycephalic monoglossary elaborated by the Babylonaire Institute in conclusion of its experiments in sectioning polymonary individuals. Their successitation of a single tongue communed to two and even three heads is apprecituelle, even if it currently collides against the polycephalic confrontation that necessitates a communitary affrontation of the implicassioned heads constituting a single front with several faces of which only one remains glossory.

The artisans of the common front being multiple can theologically multiply themselves to infinity, provided that the front enlarges in furiousmeasure as the visas are added.

The exigation of the equalibility of opinion has however not envisaged the necessif enlargement of the glossocommon object devisaging the particulinary face at the englossary tail. In polycephalic monoglossology, it thus becomes extremistically difficiliary, above a certain rather restricted number, to envisage the common tongue in proportionistic enlargissolution to the numbers envisaged. Whence it appears that it is again necessary to take into considerability the incarnivoracious hostilitation in the polyglossophile movement of tribe 14 A. The latter justly sees in the number and the differenciability of tongues the very richardise, innate in the languationed being.

### Skull Pâté (Pâté de crâne)

It is clear that a tongue being a tongue is, by this fact, at the same time different from and equal to the other tongues. This difference-equality can be accepted following a purely quantitative convention, or again according to a convention of value at once quantitative and qualitative.

After this mise en forme, we could regard our task as terminated, if two difficulties did not subsist.

In the first place, two or several beef tongues, of the same weight and age, displayed at the butcher's are considered equal from the point of view of quality. The difference resides uniquely in the fact that they are two or several instead of a single one. One can put them one beside the other or one on top of the other, counting them following the convention of parity. But once I return home with the tongue I have purchased, this tongue will change according to the culinary recipe I employ, and during cooking it will nonetheless remain the same tongue. This raw, cooked, smoked, rotten tongue is always *identical* to itself according to myth M.

In the second place, the natives of 14 A treat this observation with the most profound contempt. They affirm that a raw tongue is not identical to a boiled tongue, whereas a raw tongue can be identical to another raw tongue, precisely because they are different.

### Pick-Up Sausage (Saucisson pick-up)

The two problems enunciated above in reality make only a single one, and as soon as one perceives this the solution appears. Signs must be invented:

| | |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-87.jpg) | parallelogism or symmetric equality, |

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-93.jpg)

This series can also be expressed figuratively by a square graph, where the preceding permutations present themselves in the form of 24 oriented paths classified in order:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-88.jpg)

Immediately one understands the very precise sense that must be given to the diastructural vocalism of tongues and of the tongue of tongues. But the problems are not resolved for all that. It is therefore normal that we seek to encircle the notions more closely by demonstrating the relation between living tongues and rotten tongues. An examination of the myth on the origin of the rotten tongue, in honor in tribe 14 A, will be particularly precious to us in this regard.

**Mm 3**

*In the beginning, a very living tongue went walking about everywhere, well hung and attached to the gullet. One day, a tongue-pricker succeeded in dislodging it with an iron-tipped stick. [In English, stick is said "stick," whence comes the word "linguistick," in French "linguistique" (linguistics).] By this operation, the tongue had become raw. It had been boiled and salted, and put in preserves. Then it had been sliced and grilled, and put back in preserves. After which it had been forgotten. Because of this forgetfulness, the tongue had rotted. When finally one thought to extract it from the reserve, the rotten tongue was dried in hot air and pounded until obtaining a dry powder of rotten tongue dilutable in water. This dish was the favorite of chickens, but dogs disputed it with them.*

This myth will detain us for a long time. It is blinding, at first glance, that it faithfully restores to us, at the price of a certain number of transformations, the M myth of the tongue-dislodger.

Let us first remark the plurality of levels that shows itself in the unilateral approach of this mythic tongue, constituting a rite of initiation starting from the living and natural state, passing through the potmyth to the grilled and crushed state, to finish as diluted pulverized tongue, climbing all the rungs of the hierarchy.

Consequently, one verifies the following set of transformations:

Among the M, a raw tongue can become a rotten tongue, a cooked tongue too. A raw tongue can be cooked, but the inverse is taboo. One can dry a raw, cooked, or rotten tongue. And one obtains the following combinations:

| | | |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  | dry |  |
| raw | ![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-94.jpg) | cooked |
|  | rotten |  |

A. The living and gay tongue  
B. The raw and humid tongue  
C. The raw and dry tongue  
D. The cooked and humid tongue  
E. The cooked and dry tongue  
F. The rotten and humid tongue  
G. The rotten and dry tongue  
H. The raw and crushed tongue  
I. The cooked and crushed tongue  
J. The rotten and crushed tongue  
K. The tongue in dry powder  
L. The tongue in diluted powder  
M. The raw hot rotten tongue  
N. The raw cold rotten tongue  
O. The cooked hot rotten tongue  
P. The cooked cold rotten tongue  
Q. The raw hot rotten dry tongue  
R. The raw cold rotten humid tongue  
S. The cooked hot rotten dry tongue  
T. The cooked cold rotten humid tongue  
U. The raw hot rotten dry crushed tongue  
V. The raw cold rotten humid crushed tongue  
W. The cooked hot rotten dry crushed tongue  
X. The cooked cold rotten dry crushed tongue  
Y. The tasting tongue  
Z. The disgusting tongue  
Z' The tasted tongue  
Z" The disgusted tongue  
Etc.

This research would carry us beyond the limits we have assigned ourselves and we therefore prefer to return to the M myth on the origin of the rotten tongue.

Here appears the shabby hero-dislodger in search of lost tongues. One will not be astonished by his appearance in the account of 14 A. The text is clear on this point. It is evidently apparent that a tongue cannot be dislodged without a dislodger. He must therefore manifest himself to trigger events. The hero, having set out in search of lost tongues, nonetheless does not lose his bearings.

One will note finally and above all that the tongue in powder is a multiple tongue, or — more exactly — a tongue multiplied by division, given that a small packet of tongues represents, in the magical conceptions of tribe 14 A, the tongue in its entirety, which is the sum of all tongues existing in the world.

Counting rhyme (in "la Friquassée crotestyllonnée," Rouen, 1552)

### Fried Languoustine (Langouline frite)

Taking a retrospective view of our approach, we can say that it begins with myths whose hero is a tongue-dislodger. This recalled, it is only all the more striking to note that the myths abruptly juxtapose the motif of the dislodger and that of the tongue, as well as the motif of the tongue of tongues and that of the tongues of the tongue.

One falls back here, once again, into the hostility incarnated by the polyglossophile movement of tribe 14 A, which, seeing in the number and differentiation of tongues the very richness of being, postulates that each person holds at their personal disproportion several tongues. The most modest and at the same time most realistic requirement supposes at least a double tongue, whereas the movement took all its amplitude — outside of tribe 14 A — in Germany, in the XVIIth century, with the sacred vow: "I would like to have a thousand tongues."

[*Translator's note: This refers to the famous Lutheran hymn "O dass ich tausend Zungen hätte" (O that I had a thousand tongues).*]

It is patent that the sloganlaikifying speech that moves the monolinguistophonic adversaries of this nombrematic abundentification, namely the natives of tribe M who affirm: "Tongues of all countries, unite!" creates a contrastructural tension generative of a fugue doubled by a resurrectionnal counter-fugue rather doubitological on the ethnomorphic plane.

Recently, the studied, infernant-terrible and resorbonnacious revolt, has boiled at high temperature in the univagitated potmyths against this double opprimary injustice of inhumane exploitation and universitaire indignacity, taking for its watchword: "To each his tongue!" The argumentality of these encaged ones did not lack evidual reach. Let us consider indeed that if someone seizes three tongues, three other persons find themselves constrained to share one tongue. Thus the community of a single tongue is due to the collectivizing avidity of the polylanguorous possedentaries, which troubles our reason.

### Sole Clef in Fillets (Clé de sole en filets)

After these preliminary explanations, one will more willingly admit the utility of a return to the mythic sources of the perditional origin of the tongue by means of a divisionary comparenty between tribes M and 14 A. The origin of origin always flows from a rather original source: the tongue, sourciary origin of anything and of everything, as great things always come, by mythological extraction, from the small verbalistic origin of the entire world.

One could accuse us, it is true, of making ourselves guilty here of an originatal petition of principle, since we seem to postulate the linguomythic origin of things, which should on the contrary be the object of our demonstradation. Now, nothing is more dangerous, from the point of view of a healthy method of dislodgatory research, than to adopt, from an institution under examination, a definition that one subsequently has difficulty not finding everywhere. Given that one could run this risk with tongue and tongues, it is indicated to rely definitively on their perdition.

Here is the reason why we must here profit from the perditional elementality of our elastic scholasticiation: it offers us the possibility of a parodigmatic introduction to the beastomorphic kingdom of the principal birth of a rather current concurrential knowledge, according to which the disparietal demonstratification of the tongue coincides with the comparition of a parietal and logical mythism.

Henceforth one understands the apparent parentage of the paralogical reciprocity of our parabolical parenthesis. Similar to the paradoxical parachronism of a parallelity of laziness, receptionally pardonable following the parasitary paraphrase, it is perfectly situated on a thunderous parabase, solid and paradisiological.

### Re in Black Butter (Ré au beurre noir)

Let us now try to arrive at the internal alternative of a reversible adversity of the inverse diametry between the recipient of the exchangeable potmythic parasymphony and the receipt of its recidivist recipied. It would thus be possible, in conformity with the disparietal varietablishment, to engender all their empired and contenancial content by means of a disparate compartition founded on the saccadelic algorhythm of the paraboiling potmyth. The paregoric comparison between two potmyths, of which one from tribe 14 A treats of the origin of the mute carp, demonstrates to us the mythomatic operation of a disjunction between man and the paragoric tongue:

**Mm 4**

*In the beginning lived two twin brothers who resembled each other trait for trait. But one of the two had never emitted either a sound or a word. The father had ruined himself paying the most skilled doctors in order to give him speech, for he knew that only then could his son think. But no remedy or treatment had been able to cure the unfortunate child of his absolute mutism. His parents were on the verge of despair.*

*One day the mother returns home after having learned that there exists a sacred spring beside a rock in a distant land. This spring cures all maladies. She begs the father to give her the means to undertake the costly voyage with the mute child.*

*As it is the ultimate hope, the father accepts. He sells all the furniture of the house, down to the kitchen utensils, and the mother can thus take her son to the spring.*

*After a long voyage, she arrives before the basin that retains the cold water of the spring. Her heart beating, she throws her son into it, who is immediately seized with fury and struggles like a devil in a holy water font.*

*Risen to the surface, the child begins to howl at his mother: "Filthy bitch of a slut, what have you done to me, vile tramp? Get me out of here, foul garbage, and quick about it!"*

*At the height of joy, the mother withdraws her child from the basin and embraces him with transports, dazzled by the miracle that lets her hear the splendid flood of repugnant insults with which her son drenches her. Full of gratitude, she returns to the country and hardly has she seen the house when she cries: "Miracle! Miracle! My son speaks!"*

*The father, having run to meet her, asks her:*

*"What did he say to you?"*

*"What does it matter," replies the mother, "since he speaks."*

*"Sinister idiot," says the father, "I know well he speaks since you've taken the wrong kid!"*

*He nonetheless organizes a great feast to celebrate the return of his imbecile of a wife and of his speaking son, and above all to console, by stuffing him with food, his mute son whose tongue can only serve to lick the dishes. To this feast, he invites the aunt of the two kids.*

*They begin in silence a magnificent scarlet beef tongue, accompanied by pickles, when one hears distinctly these words:*

*"Cunt, Mamma!"*

*Everyone wonders where this crudely affectionate speech came from. It is not long before they realize that it is the mute kid who has emitted it.*

*A new miracle? The cretinous wife begins to wriggle with ease, but the aunt, a former cleaning woman at the Convent of the Birds, protests:*

*"What a way to talk!"*

*Then the mother — who does not want to be accused of having poorly raised her children — vigorously slaps the mute one, crying:*

*"Where did you learn that, good-for-nothing?"*

*As it is the first slap received in all his life, the mute one does not cry. Quite the contrary, he is seized with intense hilarity.*

*"Where did he learn that?" says the aunt. "He could tell tales about your intimate morals. One never distrusts babies."*

*The father, full as a wineskin, puts his feet in the dish and throws himself on the aunt to tear out her viper's tongue. The speaking son bites the calf of the mute one who howls like a deaf man. The dishes collapse along with all the family. Then the mute son says, before shutting himself up in his obstinate silence:*

*"Cunt, auntie?"*

[*Translator's note: "Con, maman" and "Con, tante" pun on "content" (happy/content) while literally meaning "Cunt, Mamma/auntie."*]

*Thunderstruck, the mother henceforth refuses to pronounce the slightest word. She transforms herself into a carp and flies off into the air to perch in a tree at the summit of an inaccessible mountain. And that is why carps are mute.*

This potmyth on the origin of flying carps merits on several accounts retaining our attention.

It is first closely related to another potmyth of tribe M that we shall cite and which treats of the origin of the search for lost tongues.

**Mm 5**

*The hero of tribe M is preparing to leave on a crusade to dislodge foreign tongues. During his absence his wife will be taboo. She must be protected by a chastity belt. The hero goes to the blacksmith and orders an iron belt. When, some days later, the dislodger comes to take delivery of the apparatus, he refuses it because in its middle a sexomorphic hole has been arranged, large enough to satisfy all reasonable requirements. The blacksmith then hands a carrot to the hero and invites him to introduce this carrot into the hole, which the hero does, and immediately the carrot falls, cut in two by the mechanism. Enthusiastic, the hero carries off the apparatus and adjusts it to his wife before leaving.*

*Many long years later, the hero returns to his castle; he assembles all the knights, pages, and servants of his court of masculine sex and asks them to remove their trousers. He proceeds to the examination of the noble parts and notes that all the men who remained at the castle during his absence have a sectioned penis, except one, his old friend Lancelot.*

*He embraces his friend with effusion and glorifies him in these terms: "My dear friend Lancelot, you are still my faithful and incorruptible servant. What happiness!"*

*Moved and practically thunderstruck upon hearing this praise, Lancelot is incapable of pronouncing the slightest intelligible word; one only hears joyful borborygms coming from his mouth. And this sad state will persist. Lancelot has lost his tongue forever and it is in vain that he will search for it the rest of his days.*

The particular interest of this myth is that it is founded on the antagonism between iron and the carrot; therefore between the mineral and the vegetal.

It is a fact admitted by tribe 14 A that "as the morals of a people become chaste, its tongue becomes corrupt"; thus the belted loop closes on the corrupted tongue.


## Fugue with Figs in Chromosomary Gum (Fugue aux figues à la gomme chromosommaire)

La vérité ne se mange pas?  
La musique non plus.  
Mais je dis moi  
que la poésie se mange.  
Qui mange le vent  
de sa cornemuse  
n'a que musique en sa panse.  
Déjà, ce n'est pas si peu.

[*Translation: "Truth cannot be eaten? / Music neither. / But I say / that poetry can be eaten. / Who eats the wind / of his bagpipe / has only music in his belly. / Already, that is not so little."*]

### Edible Waltz (Valse comestible)

An important point nonetheless remains to be elucidated. Let us posit that sense is purely verbal and logical since it is of vocal signification. By this fact we are constrained by articollision to identify sense with the lateral and bilateral voice.

If the notion of voice is preferable to that of sense, it is because it permits establishing the notion of hierarchitectural superiority and inferiority at loud voice (haute voix) and low voice (voix basse), which makes no sense, just as there is no height without lowness, as the following flechemantics signifies:

[*Translator's note: "Voix" (voice) puns throughout this section on "voie" (way/path).*]

| Loud voice |  |  | Low voice |

It is therefore clear that it will be preferable to replace sense with voice in the sym-and-diabolic table:

### Barrel Organ in Rome (Orgue de barbare à Rome)

It is the eminent videologist Thomas v. Lectern (Lehrstuhl) who, once again, puts us in the evidamental necessity to *see with the voice* linguophonic, if we want to see clearly enough to remain on the good voice/way of the good weather, recognizing the visual vidity that we have already distinctly confusionalized in the following pages. With a voicive (voisive) sensuality, largely narrow, he sends us on the voice/way of salutary and sensible facts, without visions or divisions or other empty duties. He sends us to the dryness of the voice/way of earth, to the humidity of the voice/way of mother (mère/mer = sea), to the smoking voice/way of the air and indicates to us the luminosity of the milky voice/way of the solar sky to, once again, return his voice/way to the minor ground, in transfusion with the visorial viciosity of the voyouish voyagers.

Before resuming our voice/way of iron and wood, it would perhaps be useful to return to the smoking voice/way of the olfactimid codifig to specify that its aroma sends us to Rome, which is not astonishing since culture was born in Rome and the smoking voice/way, being cultural (like all voices/ways, for that matter) leads us there. Therefore the illustrious Roman Code is the Olfactory Code par excellence.

### Rib Steak of Dance (Contrecôte de danse)

Our scientific research for a middle voice between the exercise of archilogical thought and dia-culinary perception had quite naturally and culturally to inspire itself from the example of music which has, since always, borrowed this voice/way. The impressive deglutive-auditive effect of swallowing a sonorized rib steak (entrecôte) amply testifies to this.

It is easy to understand that the astronomic rating (cote) of painting is, under this aspect, completely devalued (décotée). Colors lack all the auditory relevé at the cultural level. The oppositions of colors are purely natural, which is not the case in music where no natural contrast of tones shows itself. Thus the differences between colors with painturoid tendencies fall under a mode of matter, while the musiculinary tonality of a tongue depends on a mode of society, which is attested even among birds, cats, and mosquitoes.

### Bolerigor Mortis (Bolerigor mortis)

Good color is natural and good tone is cultural. The colored tongue: green, scarlet, etc., is natural when it is painted with a brush, and if one prefers the blue rib steak to the medium-rare rib steak, this has nothing to do with the Côte d'Azur (Azure Coast), which is illuminated by the myth of tribe M on the origin of the langoustine rousseau:

**Mm 6**

*The chief of the tribe has invited friends to a grand dinner. He has decided to serve them a lobster. But the pretty servant charged with the cooking has never cooked a lobster. She asks the chief how she should go about it.*

*"It's very simple," replies the chief. "You put the lobster in boiling water and you leave it there for 35 minutes. And then, one of two things: either the lobster remains blue, as it is now, and you are a faithful woman; or it becomes red and you have cheated on your husband."*

*At dinner, while waiting for the lobster, they dispose of sumptuous hors d'oeuvres. These finished, the chief does not see his lobster arriving. He grows impatient and howls in a violent and courteous tone: "Let the lobster be served!" Then the little maid arrives and brings a magnificent beast as scarlet red as her face.*

*She ragefully deposits the dish on the table and, looking at the crustacean with profound contempt, she throws at it: "Filthy beast, for one tiny little time!"*

*It is since that time that all lobsters turn red when one puts them in boiling water.*

It is evidencial that the maid was a bit too blue (naïve) to understand that she could have furnished a lobster of natural blue thanks to a little stroke of the brush. Which edifies us on the nature of colors as well as on the nature of women.

### Mazurka in Pentola (Mazurka in pentola)

The demonstratification can be pushed still further. Understood as we have understood it, the culinomorphic potmythology of the cuisine of tongues is that which manifests the greatest number of common traits with the potmythology of gastrophonic music.

The phonatists of auditive painting will doubtless protest in a loud and wide way against the privilegumene place we accord to the muzzlgemics (museaugemques), or at the very least will they claim the same favor on behalf of the graphoral and plastified arts.

We shall respond that one finds at table neither paritable truth nor veritable parity between spheric music and aquatic or oily painting.

Painting exists only because there are already objects like the tongue — and some other things to color.

Nothing, therefore, permits identifying the color of a tongue with the tongue as elementary or rudementary form. It is in fact a matter of simple creatures of capriciography, thanks to which one gives oneself over to a ridiculinary combinatory parody with absensed phantasmorphic entities.

Several congested potmyths common to tribes M and 14 A raise a contestation conveniently comforted by the aerolinguistics of the royal tripubic and the conclusion, conforming to connoted conventions, that oozes from this ensemble, confirms that the painting of colors is submitted to the superior relations of raw and stewed contrastiomy following the order of isomorphy of the good and the bad.

### Lesso Eroico (Lesso eroico)

We owe to Jean-Jacques Rousseau a discovery of importance, namely that color is called in Greek chrome (Dictionary of Music, art. "Chromatic"). We thus possess the peremptory proof of the inferiority of color in relation to tone in the intervalable hierarchy.

With this last piece of information, the circle closes. If one compares the syntagmatic chains, one notes that the diachronic intervalable scales are minuscule in the face of the scales of a tonatic intervalability. It follows that the equation between music and painting is pure anachronization since the chromatized tone is nothing but wind blowing its lung-monopolized and cultured air.

One already knows that the color of chrome is of a chemico-ideological order and that a diachrome is small while the diaton is a big fish. Thus is explained the diatonic grandeur of chromatized music compared to monochromatic art which is rather small (German: *Klein*) and chromignon.

It is hardly necessary to underline that, in the wake of the chromosopher G. Chromwell (who has chromatically enunciated the problem of the primitive chromic in a recent memoir), we take the term diachromatism in its very general intervalutation of the use of small chromosonic and musiculinary intervals, an intervalutation that covers the Greek sense and the moderate sense of general and chromosomary chromosophy.

Recently an attempt was made to make noise about the sonorous light of talking cinecity, claiming light to be noisy and colors tonic. This is an error to be rejected for — not being a myth — it would harm the journalary obscurifricassity of potmythic bollition.

### Coachman Mendelssohn (Mendelsohn cochère)

In his auditorial treatise on the *Tonic Diastructure of the Beautiful Blue Danube*, the Bavardian chancellarier Joseph Strauss demonstrates how linguistic science must, in all logic, recognize the antagonism between the insignia and the de-sign.

To render this contrast sensible, it is fitting to specify that the act of depriving semantics of its signs is called "de-signing" and the act of inculcating significations is named "ensignment" (\*) (or again "insignement"). Thus insignification is structive and designification is destructive. Instruction is significative, while painting — which is destruction — is designificative.

We must return here to a detail that has its importance. There is no painting without "de-sign" except in a particular case, that of house painting which is "indesign" and musical, forming the battery for choir beatings of the culisonic orchestration. Beating painting forms a body with architecturology and precisely its "indesign" character confirms the rule of signs, confirmation by negation of a negation. Being the inverse of the inverse of the sign, it becomes again itself significant, by the scientific path. Thus house painting furnishes us the key to the basic archivolture of linguistic archilogy.

*(\*) The original formula "to ensign a tongue," "ensignment of a tongue" has been extended to other matters. Thus one says today, by extension, "to ensign gymnastics" (or philosophy, or oenology, etc.).*

[*Translator's note: "Ensigner" puns on "enseigner" (to teach) and "signe" (sign).*]

### Minuetto Po Lenta (Minuetto po lenta)

By way of photophonic illuminations, we present a small menu, distributed here and there in the present text, for the sole purpose of confirming this oral vision from mouth to ear that permits tearing the eye from the phonomorphic extellignece.

One should therefore not be astonished to see this version attested by an inverse myth on the origin of the blow-out (gueuleton), coming from tribe 14 A and which it is opportune to introduce right now into our exposition:

**Mm 7**

*Once upon a time a gob (gueule) emitted a tone. Thus was created the blow-out (gueuleton). So be it because it is.*

[*Translator's note: "Gueuleton" (feast/blow-out) is derived from "gueule" (gob/mouth/maw) + "ton" (tone).*]

Even in its current state, quite rudimentary, this ancient myth overflows with significations.

#### Wooden Gob Amusement (Amusegueule de bois)

"To make cuisine is to hear well the call of rotten wood." This supple and relaxed truth is illustrated in a cruellelementary fashion by the potmyth of the tongue with a wooden mouth (gueule de bois = hangover), obligatory accompaniment of a bender (cuite).

[*Translator's note: "Gueule de bois" literally means "wooden mouth" but is French slang for a hangover.*]

To restore their rotten tongue to full form, the natives of tribe 14 A proceed to a traduitional ceremony hostile to the tongue:

**Recipetation R 1**

*In the first place, one soaks one's tongue in cold water for a day.*

*Then one brushes it vigorously with a couch-grass brush.*

*Then one soaks one's tongue in boiling water for twenty minutes and one passes it, immediately after, into cold water.*

*Finally, one easily removes the rough and bothersome skin, including the cornet, and the tongue is once again raw (à vif).*

### Pizzicato al Pommo d'Oro (Pizzicato al pommo d'oro)

It is natural to make noise, but it is cultivated not to make any (\*). From an auditurn point of view, it is in good tone to make music without noise. The antagonism between noise and tone thus constitutes music, following the oppositional correlation between gob (gueule) and tone. This extrapolarization with gueuletonic signification puts the two tribes in mythic opposition, according to the endogobish (endogueuloise) orientation of tribe M which considers it in good tone to berate (engueuler), contrary to the extragobish (extragueuloise) orientation of 14 A which considers it in good tone to spew (dégueuler).

This infrapolarization is due to the reciprocal accord on the colorless ternity of good tone, the dull being internal in group M and external in group 14 A.

Everything thus holds together in a good isomorphic symmetric equilibrium.

The origin of the animosity between tongues and colors is explicated in the potmyth that develops this theme among the M natives:

**Mm 8**

*After all the floras and all the faunas had been extracted from the entrails of the earth, the tongue and the colors traveled in concert. Originally the Chameleon, endowed with the longest tongue which hits the mark every time, also possessed the aptitude to take on all colors.*

*One day, this happy unity is abruptly broken by a Scottish hunter. He manages to seize the Chameleon and, proud of his prey, he places it on his multicolored kilt. It is too much for the Chameleon who bursts into a thousand pieces. This bursting makes the Scotsman burst out laughing, which offends the Chameleon in a thousand pieces who sees nothing laughable in his situation. Then the Chameleon transforms himself into a strange bird and flies away, angry at the colors, before the Scotsman has understood anything whatsoever. The Scotsman takes out a flask of whisky from his culinary pocket and, disgusted by his bad luck, he raises his spirits by taking a good swig. Then he puts the flask back in its place for it is getting late and he still has a long way to go through the mountains. He takes to the road again and suddenly his feet slip in the black night and he finds himself at the foot of a cliff after having made the entire descent on his ass. He puts his hand to his painful ass and withdraws it all wet, looks at it and as he can see nothing in the thick darkness, thinking of his bottle of whisky, he raises this prayer: "God make it be blood!"*

It is difficult to decide if the central motif here is the rupture of harmony between tongue and colors or between bursting and laughter. The microjupologist Mac Croop, of the University of Edinburgh, who has devoted his science to the examination of this problem, draws attention to a myth of the Hooligan (Voyou) tribe dwelling in the Sainte-Geneviève mountains. In his book: *Pictographic view upon the clan-destinity of kilt in the Eyrish part of Scotland*, London, 1969, he recounts the Hooligan potmyth on the origin of serial fracturing:

**Mm 9**

*Two brothers are strolling in the forest with their mother; they admire the landscape and recite bucolic poems. All three arrive at the edge of a precipice. The mother begins to express her enthusiasm for the panorama in very lyrical terms. Then, one of her sons gives her a powerful shoulder blow in the back and the mother falls into the chasm howling in a very sharp tone that is lost in the distance and the fall ends with a dry crack. The second son turns, indignant, toward his brother and says to him: "Don't make me laugh, I have chapped lips."*

Even if the bursting of lips is not here expressly mentioned, it is indubitable that laughter is forbidden because it makes the lips burst. The close relationship between bursting and laughter is thus well established as is its connection with the correlation between the sharpness of the tone and the dryness of the noise. Thus laughter is bursting, cause of bursting, or again bursting itself appears as a comicomorphic combinatory variant of fracturationnal laughter opposing the serious to the serial.

(\*) On his deathbed, the last words of His Magnificence I.L. Sandomir, founder of the College of Pataphysics, a man of high culture, were: "What is making that noise?"

### Beef Horn (Corne de beef)

The savages of tribe 14 A claim that scientists are really not funny when one takes them seriously.

Here is the scientific truth in its identity with the serious. As scientific problemotology postulates not laughing, scientific development finds itself surrounded by a most serious success after its serial victories, and thus is illuminated a potmyth of tribe 14 A on the origin of the relationship between the umbrella and the sure shot of cultural insemination:

**Mm 10**

*A very esteemed scientific hero marries at the age of 75 a young woman exhibitually sexomorphic. The year after, he becomes a father. His former students come to pay him homage for his creative virility. They ask him how he has been able to maintain himself in such vigor, and he replies: "It is not difficult. I merely profit from my experiences of the time when I went hunting big game in Africa. The method is exactly the one I employed the day I felled with a stroke of my umbrella a lion who wanted to attack me.*

*"How did that happen?" ask the students full of admiration.*

*"Well, I pointed my umbrella with precision at the lion's forehead and in a loud voice I cried 'Boom!' and the lion fell at my feet with a bullet in its head.*

*"But there are no bullets in an umbrella," the students are astonished.*

*"No, obviously," replies the scientist, "but it happens that every time I go hunting there is always a young man behind me with a rifle.*

*It is since that time that scientists always carry umbrellas when they go hunting.*

This potmyth calls for two orders of considerations. First, and as we have indicated above, the codasional rigorometry of the umbrella places us in the hydrological domain, whereas laughter is in no way mentioned in an explicit fashion in the comicology of the precedentary myth. Next, the gunshot by the cannon is identified with the fire of cuisine, which offers us an additional guarantee that in lingering on the theme of the umbrella that will be found again further on in potmyth 21, we are not straying from the kitchen.


## Quantum Cantata with Reheated Dish (Cantate quantique au plat réchauffé)

Bro, bro brille  
klokken ringer elve.  
Kejseren staar  
paa sit höje hvide slot,  
saa hvidt som kridt  
saa sort som kul  
Fare, fare krigsmand  
döden skal du lide.  
Den der kommer allersidst  
skal i den sorte gryde.  
Förste gang saa lad ham gaa  
anden gang ligesaa.  
Tredie gang saa tar vi ham  
og putter ham i gryden.

[*Translation from Danish: "Bro, bro brille / the clock strikes eleven. / The Emperor stands / on his high white castle, / as white as chalk / as black as coal / Go, go warrior / death shall you suffer. / He who comes very last / shall go in the black pot. / First time let him go / second time likewise. / Third time we take him / and put him in the pot."*]

### Song by the Wood Fire (Chanson au feu de bois)

Nowhere is the linguistic identity of music and cooking as manifest as in the song of indolinguistic cuisine. Let us therefore leave for a moment exolinguistified cooking and let us bend, during this same moment, over the musiculinary origin of the prelinguistic cooking of the indotongue attached to the being and which must be cooked to make it sing.

The chantific gastronomy of indolinguistic cooking is of a great recipetation, but one can arrive at the same interrogastric goal by different conative voices. This gastrophony has however a common denominator, since song differs from the spoken tongue in that it requires the participation of the whole body, which prevents it from being detached from the body during chantistic cooking, which is the reason why the indication "indotongue" is significass.

The cruelty of this cuisination is patent. Whether it is exercised by dry and cold pounding of the steak tartare genre, or by dry pinching, dry grilling, roastization, or hot and humid bouillon, or by cold and humid drowning, or by any of the means of a rich variabilization that cuisine offers to song, it is not doubtful that we always remain in the domain of cruelties. It is furthermore indispensable to add one's grain of salt to all these recipetations of good sharp and penetraditional tone.

### Cruelties in the Cooperage (Cruautés à la boissellerie)

The hierarchization of indolinguistic cooking is normally scaled by quantum degrees, which go from the first to the third degree, that is from blue (rare) to bloody (medium-rare) then to the fist (well-done), with the reservation that at the fist one often catches bruises (bleus). If one surpasses the third degree, the burn risks carbonizing itself in incantabilistic deacoustication. If one surpasses the fourth degree to reach the fifth, a general inflammation appears. This numerological gradification obviously belongs to a symbolorification of a logico-mathematical algebracicy that one would be wrong to take too seriously since sonhorribility superchromatic is saturated with an efficient torturapidity of receptional fracturupture.

As the goal of indolinguistic cooking is only attained if the singer spits out the piece (coughs up the information), the relation of cause to effect is here replaced by the relation of song to spit which flows from the fact that indolinguistic cooking is accompanied by certain emotivational reactions between the expected transmitter and the unexpected emitter, characteristics of prelinguistic song.

**Recipetation of the Syringe Shot (R 2)**

On the plane of chiantific cuisination, a good syringe shot can have a beef effect. It is named the "cantata with syringes," very appreciated from the alimental and morphinological point of view for the listening table.

**Pedalogical Recipetation of Honey with Tobacco (R 3)**

As the participation of the whole body is implicated in cuisinological blackmail (chantage), one first makes sure that the sole of the foot sits down at the table, either by risibiliary and gentle treatment with gaiety, following the lick-foot method of honey on the sole of the foot, or by tristicular treatment with melancoleration, following the tobaccial method of the cigarette burn. The first method requires the collaboration of a foot-licker fond of honey with foot mushroom, thus either a lion or a dog. As the dog is the most common, this method is also called the method of the "cynical song," whereas the tobacco passage is done "à la gauloise," "à la gitane," or "à la celtique," if one does not puritanize it at the stage of Virginia tobacco. The danger of using foot-lickers is not negligible; one risks, if they take a liking to it, having one's entire leg eaten up, which happens rather frequently. This is why it is recommended to replace it with a wooden leg.

[*Translator's note: "Passage à tabac" means a beating. "Gauloise," "Gitane," and "Celtique" are French cigarette brands.*]

**Recipetation of the Dish with Grilled Foot (R 4)**

The advantage of the dish with grilled foot, which makes it the preferred dish of the genre, is that song is accompanied here by dance, which provokes an augmentation of affective aesthetificassity. As he does not know which foot to dance on, the singer, set on foot on the grill, executes a dance more and more frivolous and enraged as the grill heats up, embellishing his postures with a deliciously fiery and passionate chantacion.

**Recipetation of the Dish with Boiled Foot (R 5)**

If the grilled foot is regarded as a dish full of nobility, the boiled foot is on the contrary held for an aristocratic dish. A remarkable and rather particulinary synthesis of the boiled grill, imprinted with a noble aristocracy, operates in the Burgundian dish foot. Here one normally adds carrots and potatoes to the mushroom sauce à la grecque.

**Recipetation of the Oven-Baked Paw (R 6)**

This famous recipetation of greased paw, with crematory sauce, recently invited by the great musiculinary patologist Schnulze van Schmalzhaxe, is of an exequitary delicacy extermely chantille.

Normally, it is done on all fours, that is two arm-tongues and two foot-tongues per person. One begins by putting one's paw in the dough (pâte) taking care that something remains on the fingers, which supposes a certain touch (doigté). Then one puts the finger (preferably the thumb) in the mouth, in search of the tongue-tab at the raised foot. Once one has gained a footing (pris pied), one puts one foot in front of the other, to redo a few steps: thus the meal (repas) is made.

A good dough of a woman (bonne pâte de femme = good-natured woman) enriches this patriarchal pasturage, but if one puts one's foot in the dish (mettre le pied dans le plat = to put one's foot in it) without having such a part available, one can put one's hand in the fire (mettre la main au feu = to swear to it), at the foot of a potmyth of a wise man, so true is it that it is by the foot of knowledge that one measures men. Thus one will have a pedane with two syllables of chiatric spaghetti, at one tagliatelle that any gourmet will be enchanted by it.

**Recipetation of the Roast of Fat Voice with Lemon (R 7)**

The chiaritic signification of roastification with fat voices and gentle breast (Ger.: *brat-schmalstimme*), which goes from head to foot, is considered the song of the harpooned sign; it is approved by the accompaniment of a harp with Salzburg sugar.

It can be grilled, or roasted in the oven; according to two recipetations in musiculinary harphony. The cantor cantoured becomes with carnal heating a charming sementual charcuterie by watering the lemon with potato juice thumbing its nose (au pied de nez).

**Recipetation of Cooking with Sewn-Shut Mouth (R 8)**

Gastrocantic cooking requires a recipetation in uncomfortable opposituation: cooking with sewn-shut mouth and amorphonic, according to whether the subject has the mouth watering or a dry mouth. A certain linguophobia is here counter-announced by the zipper-closing methodocrity that closes with a lightning bolt (coup de foudre = love at first sight) the mutinutile mutism. It is fundamentally a matter of the herology of the resistance dish of stewed cuisine, in contrastruction with the gift of the tongue (don de la langue = gift of gab) and the taking of speech. Contrary to the externutatory tongue, the internatory tongue testifies to a confiturial and courteous delicacy comparable to the chivalric rectitude of the hippophallic tongue that gives itself vigorously to the cat.

### Gamy Pathétique (Pathétique faisandée)

We do not undertake a complete clichematization of the innumerable glossocantic recipetations of which we have given only a very succinct exemplification. What interests us above all in them is that they are in a way the key in hand, detached from musiculinary cuisinology, that leads us to the very source of the structive originality of originalistic potmyths, which traces the culturation flowed by its well-gamy imprints on linguistic osmosis.

In his book *The Origin of Origin* the Greenlandic philosoplologist Abraham Isaac Jacobson, drawing the conclusions of his experiences in a missionary milieu, demonstrates to us that the original is initial, as the desorigin is denichiatory, which explains that denichisation is preceded by initiation. He confirms his thesis by a potmyth of the origin of the foot in the dish, in favor in a Thulean tribe of his country:

**Mm 11**

*The women of the Thulean tribe had long been bothered by herds of elephants who, during the hot seasons, calmed their ardors by strolling in the fridges of their kitchens. The women however never managed to dislodge them nor to discover how they installed themselves in the fridges. This is why they decided to address themselves to a dislodger hero and said to him:*

*"Since you know how to dislodge tongues, you should also be capable of dislodging a herd of elephants in a refrigerator, and initiate us into the art of knowing whether they have passed there or not for we have no desire to meet them."*

*The hero sets himself on the trail of the elephants and, after a few days of exploration in the fridges, he returns to the women and explains to them:*

*"If you find elephant footprints in the butter, you can be sure they have passed that way, it's semantic; otherwise you will always be exposed to doubt."*

*This is the origin of the foot in the dish (putting one's foot in it) and the reason why one puts butter in a dish in order to dislodge the foot in butter.*

One finds oneself here before a traveling potmyth, whose exact similiar flourishes in the Glug-Glug tribe of 14 A, except that instead of elephants one speaks of a herd of seals; that they stroll, not in refrigerators, but in beds; that it is not butter that is in question, but bolsters; and that in place of footprints there are seal hairs, which signifies that the buttered foot is naked (à poil = naked/with hairs).

This is why the women of 14 A refuse to be painted in oil, on the pretext that, in their tribe, everything is done with butter.


## Toccata with Foie Gras in a Crate (Toccata au foie gras en caisse)

Il était une fois  
Une marchande de foie  
Qui vendait du foie  
Dans la ville de Foix.  
Elle me dit une fois:  
C'est la dernière fois  
Que je vends du foie  
Dans la ville de Foix,  
Car les gens de Foix  
N'achètent pas de foie.

[*Translation: "Once upon a time / A liver merchant / Who sold liver / In the town of Foix. / She said to me one time: / It's the last time / That I sell liver / In the town of Foix, / For the people of Foix / Don't buy liver." — This is a French counting rhyme playing on the homophones "fois" (time), "foie" (liver), "Foix" (a town), and "foi" (faith).*]

French counting rhyme

### Sizzled Pastorale (Pastorale rissolée)

Let us now place ourselves in another perspective, by posing the question of the supplementary contribution of chromotification to the diapositive semantism between the raw and the bender (cuite). Here the important exformations can be extracted from potmyth M 6 on the origin of the langoustine rousseau where the semantic function is demoralistic, diametropolized between the maid (bonne = good) and the male, therefore between the feminine and the masculine, as an ethicological contrastruction which, in spite of its apparent simplicity, exploits a considerable number of beliefs of good liver/faith (bonne foi/foie) as much as bad whose affrontal structism merits a serious serialization that we are going to study.

In tribe M a good bender (bonne cuite) corresponds to a bad raw (mauvais cru). The good raw, in 14 A, inversely provokes a bad bender. The colored semantics, which reflects this juxtaposition, reserves for us a double surprise. The good bender due to the bad raw renders the members of tribe M black, whereas the members of tribe 14 A are grayed (grisés = tipsy) by the bad bender from the good raw, to the point of becoming completely round (ronds = drunk) when the members of tribe M are squarely black (carrément noirs = completely drunk).

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-182.jpg)

These results present first a theoretical interest. The juxtaposition of the black square to the gray round corresponds to the classic contrast in geometry, inevitable derivation of a decorative turn created by the culture of the square of the circle.

### Litter of Pigs (Portée de cochons)

If, in tribe M, black is attributed to the square bender, one associates, in tribe 14 A, the foot with black and red with the lips, thus with bursting (see M 9). The antagonism between black feet (pieds noirs) and lipstick (rouge à lèvres) is treated with profound comprehension by the engineer Stendhal in his work *The Red and the Black*. It is necessary here to denounce once more the fourbological theory of the Italian sociologist Stained Veal (Vitello Macchiato) already expulcified on the subject of his Bruitonnic reconciloiphilia, for he renews his attempt by trying to link the black foot of tribe 14 A to the M bender, on the pretext that the bender goes to the feet, as the lame (fourbu) who has drunk becomes limping (boiteux), which requires a wooden leg. With regard to the unijambistological potmyth, such a soulogy does not stand on its legs. One can limp on one leg, but not drink with a wooden leg, a really too easy solution offered to centipedes. We believe we give the just interpretation of the problem of the tongue with foot in the following chapter which treats of the alarming badchansons (méchansons) of the foot in the dish. Whatever the case may be, we have clearly refuted the thesis of Doctors Mireille and Jean Nohain, summarized in the numerotechnical formula: "He's a gardener who limps and drinks."

[*Translator's note: "Pieds noirs" (black feet) refers to French settlers in Algeria. "Fourbu" (exhausted/foundered) plays on "fou" (crazy) and "bu" (drunk).*]

### Electric Chair Grill (Grillade a la chaise électrique)

But there is better. The presence of the white tongue, a marmythriolectic sign of bad liver/faith (mauvaise foi/foie), establishes a culisonic triangle.

A potmyth M on the origin of bad liver/faith comes to clarify this problematic:

**Mm 12**

*A dislodger of benders returns to his mother's home. She notices that he is of bad liver/faith (mauvaise foi/foie) since he has an all-white tongue. She paints his tongue with pulverized and pillulomorphic charcoal found in the pharmacy. Thus the white tongue becomes a black tongue.*

*Another faith (foi) appears in place of the bad liver/faith and demands that he go green (se mettre au vert = take a break/go vegetarian). It opposes, in a very raw manner, all benders, thus establishing the antagonism between the zoologist and the vegetarian. All this is executed in good faith, torn from the hunter of benders who takes well the liver/faith cooked in a delicious manner according to the famous recipe of foie gras à la bigourdane, tricked à la Montrouge:*

**RECIPETATION R.7**

*Put on each crate and nail a sautéed escalope of foie gras in dynamythological butter; alternate with round croutons macerated in a little cognac around a round tampon; arrange the bigarreaux of foie gras in a pyramid; cook on the grill over low heat in a very cold dish by dipping the molds in warm water garnished with macaroni in cubes; if the finger penetrates it easily, one can deduce and casserole that it is the jewel of French cuisine in slipper.*

### Grilled Chopin (Chopin grillé)

A nested tongue is natural; a true tongue is cultural: therefore the tongue must be dislodged. And the cultural goal is precisely the culinary toppling (culbuture) of the tongue to be dislodged, which can be done on foot, on horseback, by car, by boat, with various instruments as well as with bare hands.

It is at the stage of the passage from the prelinguistic to the linguistic that the operator of this operative culturation introduces himself: the linguist or tongue-dislodger as recommender recommended of a repetittive and reciprocated research.

The denichiative of this operation is conducted in part following the chivalric codificacity, become quantum with the rapidition of the industrial age according to the straddled calculation where the citronomy of the two horses (deux chevaux = Citroën 2CV) presages the straddling of chevological hairs at astronomical and vicionary figures, which makes the dislodgement of tongues on horseback outdated. One will nonetheless recognize that it had its glorious epoch.

The dadalogical potmyths of wooden horses whether at Troy or on other leguminous battlefields confirm this largely.

### Jig with Nuts (Gigue a la noix)

It goes quite otherwise with pedalogical pedestrianism. Pedestrial denichiatory encountered a success of pedicular durability thanks to scientific pedometry which pedunculated itself with a rather paigning pegasite. Thus the firm-footed dislodger has managed to retain a stony piety for the trampling pietism of the denichtic concept of the tongue. Whatever consideration one brings to the pederistics necessary for linguistic denichification, one nonetheless remains in the domain of artistic and artisanitary manual labor.

The dragonic phenomenology of Hussar cavalry manifests a dialectical predilection for dragonier tongues. With time this predilection dragged itself into a drogmatic dragonale to recuperate later the humanistic tongue already lost in festivalary lectistermination. Such that, creditary to the denichification, the ritualistic develops according to the sportuarian formula: "Our might is our strength," which distinguishes the tongue-cutters, the tongue-choppers, the prickers, the picklocks, and the tongue-tearers, these last representing the direct and pure manual labor, while the instrumentation of the others: pikes, swords, lances, hooks, knives, sabers, axes, alters them. One sees here repeated the contrastreoriental development of the sportel and the industrial, except in the particulinary case of aerolinguistics of which we shall treat the mythomania elsewhere.

### Beuglophony with Fat Voices (Beuglophonie a voix grasses)

The opening of the ritual bawling is the most faschinant sacral momention of the hand-tearer. All tribes agree to sound the shot of the opening by hand, as multiple myths explain, even if the second ritual is often troublesome because of the maniacal intrusion into the gob where it greatly risks remaining, which happens from time to time to the great satisfaction of the blow-out (gueuleton). The most solennelistic moment nonetheless remains the third potmythic stage in the course of which one witnesses the extractional seizure of the tongue by hand, a thousand times superior to the iron hooking used by artisanitary industry.

Bilateral extraction bearing on two gobs at once appears in several legends as a sublimifying satisfacture in the relation between dislodgeon and dislodger with the nestonnester, whereas the collaboration of several persons to dislodge a same tongue belongs to the infrasportive domain.

Extreme exaltation in linguistic research can make the fervent hero hunter jump into the gob, as is related in myth Mm 14. It even happens that a whole team of researchers installs itself on the platter of the tongue.

The origin of this dislodgiary expedition by team of glospeleologists, we see it first in a potmyth on the origin of the umbrella-tongue which, for the reader little familiarized with the subtleties of the archaic gross tongue 14 A, we give here in a recent version, sluttishly vulvairized:

**Mm 13**

*The Alesiates, pressed to come to blows, are surprised by a heavy rain. Pantagruel, to protect them, has them line up and squeeze together, then drawing his tongue halfway out covers them with it like a hen her chicks.*

*I, recounts the nesting hero of 14 A, go near them to take shelter, but as I cannot manage to, I climb on top and thus walk two leagues on Pantagruel's tongue, so that I enter his mouth.*

*What do I see? I walk there as one does at Saint-Sophie-de-Constantinopostelle, I see there great rocks like the Danish mountains — those are his teeth — and great meadows, great forests, strong and great cities like New York and Tokyo.*

*The first person I meet is a fellow planting his asparagus. He tells me he is taking them to sell in the city which is behind and which is named Aspharage.*

*I take the train to Aspharage. In the dining car, a traveler on a bicycle is hunting pigeons. I ask him where these pigeons come from. "From the other world," he tells me, that jerk. I deduce from this that when Pantagruel yawns the pigeons enter his throat in full flight, believing it to be the Rothschild Bank.*

*I arrive at Aspharage. The riot police ask me for my pass. "Is there plague?" "Rotten meat," they reply, "people are dying so much around here that they've requisitioned even the scooters to carry away the stiffs." "Dear Lords, where is this tragedy taking place?" "Ray-face," they reply courteously, "it's happening in Laryngia and Pharyngia, two capitals like Chicago and Sarcelles."*

*I inquire and I learn that this plague is caused by a stinking and foul exhalation that recently came from the abysses. In eight days, three and 7,548,972 and five persons have died of it.*

*I discover, by squeezing my lemon (brain), that it is a putrid breath coming from Pantagruel's stomach who ate the other day tons of tripe stew with garlic.*

*I move away from these accursed places, I pass between the rocks that are Pantagruel's teeth, I climb on the highest where seventy thousand rotten sheep tongues make a little slimy spot, and from there I admire the most beautiful landscape in the world: the shantytown of Nanterre, the mining villages of the North, the gas plant of Gennevilliers, the ossuary of Douaumont, and an infinity of Maine-Montparnasse complexes.*

*After four months in these places of delight, I descend by the back teeth, I arrive at the jaws, and finally I exit by letting myself slide down the beard.*

*"Where do you come from?" Pantagruel asks me.*

*"From your throat, sir. I have been there six months. I nourished myself on the most delicious morsels that passed through your gullet and of which I took my share."*

*"Really? But where did you shit?"*

*"In your throat, sir."*

On our languicionary dissection table, this potmyth is mechanically sewn with white thread to potmyths 10 and 21 which exalt, they too, the vertutility of the umbrella. Nothing astonishing there. More or less abandoned by Negroes who prefer the plastifurred impermeable with white sauce, the umbrella finds a new luster in India where it is a sign of dignity. It is not rare, travelers report, to encounter, on the grand boulevards of Noodle-Delice (Nouille-Délice/New Delhi), sacred cows who carry umbrellas while sticking out their tongues, either to the left in descence when the umbrella is open or to the right in ascendance with introduction into the right nostril when the umbrella is closed, or again in hanging bib with glossographic drool at each expulsification of their spiritist dung.

The most impressive denichiatory nonetheless surpasses the bilateral stage through the use of arms, legs, and teeth with the goal of dislodging five tongues at once.

### Cutlet with Beethoven Juice (Cotelette au jus de Beethoven)

From afar, the most sensationed denichiatory remains the fulgurated action of dragonomic hydrolinguistics by the metamorphological novellation felt in the potmyth of the submarine frogman, with the scoundrelly (crapuleuse) tongue. The hydroglosomorphic denichiative embarks here in potmyths of the high sea at low tide, of a marentual diaphoresis diapassionating, which define the chantific musiculism of cod tongues and their mortubrant cygnifichanson by mucous and mosaic mortificassity in the line of the motorized watchword in vaginarian course of embarcationary hydromercantilism.

It is therefore easy to understand that there is no hydrolinguistic question that is not resolved in a hydrophonological way. The barbaritional graindorgue of the cruelistic implantation of naturational culturation in diapedésual quittanciation of the bitten tongue is thus founded in biting contrastruction with the beak in the water, so true is it that one cannot realize a dream if one dreams reality.


## Interlude with a Shot of Red in Timpani (Interlude au coup de rouge en timbale)

Pirulin, Pirulin piangeva  
volevo l'insalata  
e la mamma mezza matta  
gli gettava una cibatta  

A mezzanotte in punto  
passava un aeroplano  
e di sotto c'era scritto  
Pirulin, Pirulin, stà zitto.

[*Translation from Italian: "Pirulin, Pirulin was crying / he wanted the salad / and the half-crazy mother / threw him a slipper // At exactly midnight / an airplane passed / and underneath was written / Pirulin, Pirulin, be quiet."*]

Italian children's round.

### The Barrel Organ Duck (Le canard limonaire)

The situgraphic localization of the tongue can lead to confusion. The unwarned tongue-dislodger can run into a serious difficulty in discovering his prey. We shall dissipate this difficulty.

A certain number of proofs have been assembled in favor of a connection, directly or indirectly conceived in the native mind, between the tongue and the gob, as well as between the gob and the head.

This postulated, we can hope to put one meal more in front of the other by posing a new muzzleographic question: how are these connections conceived?

One will immediately remark that there exists an infinite combinatory variety tributary in native thought on this subject: the head can be attached to the end of the tongue, as the tongue can be attached to the end of the head. The tongue with the head at the end can be in direct or indirect connection with the gob which for its part can be applied to the head. Just as the head can be on the tongue, so it can be in the gob, and similarly — we have seen — the gob can be in the head.

It is therefore not by chance that there are stubborn tongues (langues entêtées) like stubborn gobs (gueules entêtées), and berated heads (têtes engueulées) like berated tongues (langues engueulées).

Consequently, one will complete the schemas of the preceding pages by the introduction of the hook ![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-237.jpg) as sign of unilateral attachment, and we shall have the following combinations:

| | | | |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| head | ![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-237.jpg) | tongue | ![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-237.jpg) | gob |
| tongue | ![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-237.jpg) | gob | ![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-237.jpg) | head |
| tongue | ![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-237.jpg) | head | ![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-237.jpg) | gob |

and so on.

(We have voluntarily reserved for the end the problem of the tongue attached to the tail and that of the stubborn tail.)

### Soprano in Crust (Soprano en croute)

Trognonostics depends on several muzzlemorphic trognotations. One will therefore not be astonished to see adversitations to various versions both meaty and leguminous divide gobs by bilateral culinoppositions.

In the trognonomic potmythology of tribe M, the wolf's gob (gueule de loup) is held to be a flower: it thus belongs to the vegetal kingdom. On the contrary, the M natives judge the wooden gob (gueule de bois = hangover) bestial: it falls under the animal kingdom. As for tribe 14 A, it considers the beef tongue as integrated into the botanomorphic order and the iron tongue (langue ferrée = railway) (for interesting and obscure reasons that we cannot elucidate here) as subject to the zoomorphic order.

**Mm 14**

*A dislodger hero, squarely black, throws himself into the wolf's gob to sleep. But he has mistaken the genre: he believes he is resting his wooden gob (hangover) in the vegetation. The wolf of the gob is animal and thus finds itself thrown into an offended animation. The wolf begins to berate (engueuler) the intruder.*

*The noise wakes the hero several times who, each time, exclaims: "Shut your gob!" (Ta gueule!) At the end, unable to take any more, he thunders: "Shut your filthy gob, for God's sake!"*

*The wolf then shuts his filthy gob, and here is the tongue-dislodger locked in the wolf's gob.*

*Seeing that he is no more advanced, the hero calms down and decides to consider himself the owner of the wolf's gob. But he is constrained to clean it with flour so that this filthy gob can become his own clean gob (gueule propre = proper mouth).*

*In this operation, he misses (loupe) the filthy tongue which is the tongue of the berated (engueulé) wolf. The hero finds himself properly in his floured gob with the missed (loupée) tongue. The situation cannot go on forever. He says to himself: "I must manage to dislodge this filthy tongue. I must not miss it anymore" (la louper).*

*Upon hearing these remarks, the wolf's tongue is seized by tics more and more accentuated. The hero does not let himself be impressed. In a masterly effort, he dislodges the wolf's tongue by throwing it with skill out of the gob.*

*Once extracted from the wolf's gob, the tics of the tongue cease to be indotics. By metamorphosis, the tongue transforms itself into an exotic wolf tongue.*

*The wolf who sees himself amputated of his tongue forbids the hero to exit from his gob. He demands that the hero replace the functions of the missing tongue. And thus the tongue-dislodger becomes himself the tongue high in tics of the wolf of his own gob.*

[*Translator's note: "Louper" means both to miss and to wolf (related to "loup" = wolf). "Tics" plays on "tique" (tick) and nervous tics.*]

Although the ancient authors have not signaled this potmyth among the Montparnassians, it is encountered very frequently in tribes of tongue M or in those over which M influence is exercised.

### Tartar Fritter with Drum (Beignet tartare au tambour)

The potmyth does not explicitly mention the origin of raw and bender (cuite), but, one might say, it knows so well that there lies its true subject that it restores almost literally the episode of the bender of thunder transformed into a wooden gob (hangover).

In support of this rapprochement, one can argue that the potmyth M contains a detail at first sight incomprehensible. How to explain that the hero employs flour to clean the wolf's gob? Unless one interprets this gesture as the transformed reflection of a similar act included in potmyth 14 A on the origin of the rotten tongue, the detail would be completely arbitrary.

Flour being a pounded powder corresponds exactly to the pounded powder of the rotten and dry tongue. The rotten wooden gob (hangover), to which we have already had recourse, being, for its part, identical to the making of cuisine mediatized between heaven and earth, it buckles the belt because it would be adventurous to go further in the dialysis of the potmyth which poses a delicate ethnographological problemation.


## Suite with Beef Rump Good Woman Style (Suite à la culotte de bœuf façon bonne femme)

Un perroquet  
Qui avait la colique;  
Il fit un pet  
Qui sentait le navet.  
Son père lui dit:  
Tu joues de la musique?  
— Mais non, papa,  
Je joue du flageolet.  
Du flageolet,  
Tu y es.

[*Translation: "A parrot / Who had the colic; / He made a fart / That smelled of turnip. / His father said to him: / You're playing music? / — But no, papa, / I'm playing the flageolet (bean/recorder). / The flageolet, / There you are."*]

French counting rhyme.

### Piston Cone of Fries (Cornet de frites au piston)

Until now we have advanced in our study by relying on a contrastruction, supposed known to our readers. The moment has come to clarify the operatheutic notionology of the constructurism implied in the framework of our exposition. The gustative procedurability of glossomorphy requires indeed a hierarcheer codification, ultra and infraglossoriel, produced by the superposition of the tasted tongue on the supposition of the tasting tongue. By posing a tongue to be tasted on the soudentary tongue, the croquary process triggers itself in all its natural and cultural hierarchism (\*).

We are in the presence of the bilateral maneuver consisting of *situating* as well as *posing*, which situates the pose in positional posituation and in propositional and contrapositional logical and lay, disloyal and loyal contrastucturation.

Here first imposes itself the question of the pose between the semential poser and the possessed in bilingual position, or again between the active and the passive in the act of gustomatic passage. In other words, the oppository parallelism affirms itself between the nature and culture of the natural Cultivated and the nature of the cultivator. Similarly the actifacial and passifarcal reciprocession (in one way or another) by symetary facsimilitude of an astronomical consternability explains the reactionary character of shareholders by definisimal calculation, following the impression of langust expressions of ungust exgustations. The pose of the passive tongue thus puts pressure on the active tongue by impressive posture of culture on nature.

The savages of tribe 14 A are repetitive posers, rigorously applying their apophthegm *Rest yourselves* (Reposez-vous) which cuts cleanly between what is posible and what is imposible or exposible.

*(\*) See the thesis **Scientific braintest on the intestinal taste of tongues** by Prof Hot. Hilton, Ph. D. D. Sc. from the Testimonian Institute of human testamentality, Harvard University U.S.A., 1972.*

### Leeks Andante Cantabile (Poireaux andante cantabile)

The tasted tongue is cultural and passive (at least if it passes, which it normally does when it is well cooked in bittersweet sauce with parsley), whereas the tasting tongue is natural and active. As the cooked tongue introduces itself in superposition with the raw tongue by imposition, it must necessarily be impossible to render the glutoid procedure possible.

But that is not all. The codifficult systemantology of a well-hung tongue depends on its expossibility, which superposes impressionism on expressionism in an irreproachable reciprocity, while the irresponsibility of vocal consumption produces a biodynamic hierarchitecture, which is proportional to the degest supposition of the suppository gesture.

### Cauliflower Crescendo Non Tropo (Chou-fleur crescendo non tropo)

Here we are at the full center of the diacodery established between the natural tongue and the cultural tongue.

Since insistent nature does not exist any more than existent culture insists, the contrastruction between the two sistations diametrizes itself between insistence and existence, the domain of nature being slightly vaster than that of culture which directs and dominates it down to the last star by linguistic astronomology. Thus it is phallacious to say that culture imitates the world of nature by putting itself crossways for it is the inverse that occurs. Nature does not understand culture which encompasses it by its global and dominatrickish knowledge, correlative to the thermic reign of the one and the other, proper to signify it as it signifies in return since it is uniquely the cultural reign that gives a significassity to the natural reign which in itself is insignificant. Whence results a diametral exclusivity of culture in relation to the nature of man, in irreversible symmetry to his cultural reversal.

It is hardly necessary to underline that culture is in an eccentric position while nature is in excellent concision, art being, itself, in concentric decision. It is therefore normal that nature represents animality and culture humanity. Man who does not exist, but continues to insist, is consequently an animal. And humanity, which is vegetal, is cultural as a leguminous morpheme, element of etiological signification in a function antipathetic to man understood as a phoneme, element of articulation devoid of signification since belonging to the reign of nature. The animaladive artisticulation of non-existing man is thus placed at the inverse of cultural fruits which, for their part, are quite full, on the contrary, of polyversal verse (worms).

[*Translator's note: "Vers" means both "verse" and "worms."*]

### Salad with Egretto (Salade à l'egretto)

The revercibility of this diametry between the cultivated plants of humanity and the savage men of animality is remarkable in this that the vegetal, being already sensible (sensé = making sense), can no longer ever be sensitive (sensible) and that leguminous humanity, already cultivated, becomes uncultable, thus respecting the culisonological law established by Honoré de Balzac: "One cannot cultivate leeks in a wheat field."

It is therefore legitimate to conclude by applying the anathema expounded in the potmythology *From Caviar to Chocolate* by the savageologist Charles Bouquet, according to which nature imitates culture in reverse as one can see below:

a. \[Nature\]		\[Culture\]

One also observes a return of culture toward reversed nature:

b. \[Culture\]		\[Nature\]

As nature is the animal or the bad savage, it civilizes itself in reversed and leguminous culture of humanity, the contrapuntal movement also being effected from returned culture to the nature of the savage herbs of humanity, just as flesh is hay (dry grass):

c. \[Culture/Humanity\]		\[Nature/The Noble Savage\]

d. \[Man/Animal\]			\[Humanity/Vegetal\]

Culture by right transfusing itself into verse (worms), and vice versa, according to its new nature at the reverse of vicious right, natural versality becomes a new desorganic civilization.

In accord with the hierational selectricity, man is no more stupid (bête) than the plant can be planted. If the plant has leisure to be stupid, it is exclusively of a passioned stupidity, just as the passive opposes itself to the actioned stupidity of animals in animalation. One witnesses here the passage from guided verdure through teleguided fauna which leads to man intelleguided by the intelligence of electronic brains, which guide the human flora by their intelectricity, removing from intellectuals the useless weight of intelligence and replacing it with extellignece which is *the other*.

### March to the Flageolets (Marche aux flageolets)

If one accepts the demonstruosity of Condillac, a science is a well-made tongue and vice versa. As a well-made tongue must be cooked just right, a good potmythic fire is indispensable to the development of science which, by this fact, identifies itself with the tongue of fire, on condition of naturally assuring a good draft of the small and large aerolinguistic airs and of having a moistening juice and a stock of embers, the moistening factor having always to be a white stock. This scientific combination is extremely sparkling since it farts fire and flames.

Thus are amalgamated in an insoluble potmythic compost the fart and science fusing in a sonorous flame of an oral luminosity codified carminatively in exact concordance with the linguistic optics of the glossopyromorphic petography of the illumination with tongues of fire licking the sloping coast that sacrepitates toward the God Crepitus. This is why we treat the fart with respect for it is rare not to repeat oneself (se repéter/répéter).

[*Translator's note: Crepitus was the Roman god of flatulence.*]

Consequently, tympanitic petology occupies a central and explosible place in our herological study. Its bombouphonic violacelebrity is due to this contradictionary problemorphy that antigels the gelatinous linguophoboreal illumination in the counterfarthed light on the accoustasticated diaoptics that confirms an opulent potmythology from which we extract only the most discreetly fuming examples in our diaphragmentary monstruction.

The reader senses, by all his physopsophic pores, that we are rooting, for the roadway of his cerebral circumvoluminations, a loose earth of an incommenstruable fertility. Indeed, analyric aedopsophy is of a signaletic semantism essensuelly gestural. The petomorphic gesture counteracts congestions digestively. The problem of semantic simulacrity thus finds itself raised, by articulated linguistic hausmosis, to the level of a veritable semiscientific similitude absolutely indispensary to a semiology concurring to inflate science with its inherent pneumatosis.

### Aphonic Radishes (Radis aphones)

But there is more. The diametropolarization between animal and vegetal, identical to that we observe between nature and culture or between man and humanity, is analogous to the contrastruction between man and woman, man being natural and animal and woman vegetal and humanitarian, which is sensed in the olfactive oppositionology of cultural and feminine perfume and of natural and masculine stench, metronomized in economic kilometrage in the potmyth of 14 A on the origin of the calculable appreciation of codified olfacticity:

**Mm 17**

*A savage and corpuscular hero enters a car of the metropolitan and immediately sniffs with avidity the exquisite perfume emanating from a pretty person in precious hooker fur (fourrure de tapin).*

*Seeing the reflective mien of the sniffer, the lady satisfies her scientific curiosity and tells him: "It's Chanel. 5,000 francs the bottle."*

*Very impressed, the hero withdraws into a digestive mutism, which soon puts him in the necessity of letting go a wind, of an infinite bruitonic discretion, but charged with a pestilential stench of long and durable range. The lady is in turn subject to characterized snifloid reactions. The hero, convinced that it is in courtological morals to exchange olfactological information, turns toward the beauty and tells her: "It's flageolet (bean). One franc sixty-five the kilo."*

Here the olfacticide coding of cultural semantomorphy, combined, in a numerotic struction, with natural semaphory, spreads, from gesture to digest, on a scale of values clearly morphemere, which explains everything.

A rather similar olfactive oppositionology is recognized in the potmyth of tribe M on the origin of the petition of principle, where we find ourselves equally confronted with the problem of mutual embracement:

**Mm 18**

*A peripapatician of strong corpulence invites a young innocent hero to be deflowered by her expert care.*

*As soon as they are in intimacy, she proposes to him the famous exercitation of culilinguedification: "I want to initiate you," she says, "to the sublime secret of the sixty-ninth degree."*

*The expectant hero accepts. As soon as he is in potsituation with his partner and begins to feel out the vaginarian terrain, she expresses an ample projection of intestinal gas that the young hero wipes away not without difficulty. He nonetheless continues his work, but quickly receives a second wind still more mephitic which, this time, cuts off his breath for several seconds. He heroically resumes his task, but at the third wind, absolutely repugnensible and appalwind, he abandons and declares with respect: "I beseech you, Madam, to excuse me: I believe I shall not make it to the end. Deign to pardon me: I renounce the remaining 66."*

Without the shadow of a doubt, this potmyth consecrates the definitive defeat of logico-mathematical algebraicity that the young hero has taken much too seriously, whereas the seriality of this mythic rite is imaginary. It moreover appears from this that one must accord no confidence to the mythism of images, since culture is the jostled resultant of the polarization between the natural and the artificial.

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-316.jpg)

The quasi-mortal petomania from which our hero narrowly escapes by a precipitate flight opens to us new scientific horizons on the true questions without answers.

### Dandelions with Helicon (Pissenlits à l'hélicon)

In native thought, the idea of the tongue covers all sorts of equivocations, as well horizontally as vertically, and particularly when the tongue and its double are confronted by diametric symmetry, raised or lowered.

The bilateral affront of linguistic kissing (baisement) conceals an extremely embracing problem. It is the destiny of human things (therefore of tongues) to always lower (baiser = to kiss/to lower) while distancing themselves from their source of action. The result is a complication of the implied situmorphie to the measure of the number of tongues and orientations retained. In respecting the logico-mathematical codation, one advances that the number of possibilities stops definitively at sixty-nine, but one would be wrong to take this limit too seriously. Notwithstanding, one discovers a double hooking that merits a new sign:

![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-317.jpg)

Let us drop here a remark. It would be dangerous to ignore that the glossoculinary ethnosophy of mutual embracement implies a codative problem relative to the messageristic sense of the irreversified wavelength between the kissed kisser and the kissness of the kiss, as much at the shore as at the arrival.


## Serenade with Tied Arms (Sérénade à bras liés)

Un cuisinier quand je dîne  
Me semble un être divin  
Qui, du fond de sa cuisine,  
Gouverne le genre humain;  
Qu'ici bas on le contemple  
Comme un ministre du ciel  
Car la cuisine est un temple  
Dont les fourneaux sont l'autel.

[*Translation: "A cook when I dine / Seems to me a divine being / Who, from the depth of his kitchen, / Governs the human race; / Let him here below be contemplated / As a minister of heaven / For the kitchen is a temple / Whose stoves are the altar."*]

Désaugiers.

### Sea Salt Violin (Violon sel marin)

At the stage where our exercitations presently pursue themselves, our most sportive readers will assuredly have remarked that since the beginning of this book we have constantly been dealing with the tongue. We shall even venture to suggest that the tongue is a basic *given* (donnée) of our study. If this hypothesis were found to be loyalized, it would be congruent to admit the tongue as given, and the *gift* (don) of the tongue as a system of general value, which is very embarrassing for the gift is *free* (gratuit) and without notional rapport with the economy, as expounded in the writing of Asger Jorn *Critique of Political Economy*.

Already authors of the XVIth century had signaled forms of culinary dualism between fat and flesh. The comfortable study by the Englishman Andegg Bacon *The chair of grace* foresaw the insolubilization of the problem of economic gratitude. Observing that one must scratch a lot to put aside some savings he wondered if gratuitousness in the dear-cheap opposition is better bargain, being less dear (cher = dear/expensive), than cheap (bon marché), or if on the contrary the free is of a gracious preciosity more than flesh (chair/cher). The inquiry on cuisine in fat and flesh continues still.

### Slices of Valkyrie of Lamb of Life (Tranches de Walkurie d'agneau de vie)

It nonetheless remains that it is by taking into account all these ecological and treasury factors that one can sense that there is a bone (il y a un os = there's a catch). Many experiences attest that the daring tongue (langue osée) divides the tongue into dear (cher) and bone (os), creating a philosophistic osmosis in the provocative contrevocation.

As the *precious* does not enter into the framework of economy either, we locate three commentric axes differentialized by an admirable mouserial conclusion, today classic, namely that *the present is the gift, because one gives presents*. By this we can conclude that the past is the received and the future the requested. The progromist diametroopposition thus distinguishes, by three tempos of receptional offering, the three possible oppositions in the diaconnomical situgraphie:

gift → received  
offering → gift  
offer → demand

### Reversed Cymbal (Cymbale renversée)

Several facts confirm that one has not asked for what one receives in the potlatch-gift-received relationship, and that one never receives, in the gift-offering relationship, what one prays to be given. It is only in the economic relationship offer-demand that there is controllable reciprocity.

Henceforth we understand that the offer-demand relationship opposes itself to the two others by its civilizorial codificassity between the symmetry of exchange and the equality of reciprocals, which transforms the potlatchological outbidding into mercenary surplus-value, as elucidated in the *Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Egalitarian Thought in Latin Civilization* by JJ. Le Roux, where culture is opposed to civilization and similarly culture, because barbarous, to savagery. This point of view is well specified in the book by Asger Jorn *The Eure of Calva*.

[*Translator's note: "L'Eure du Calva" puns on "L'heure du calva" (the hour of calvados) and Eure, a French department.*]

A diagrammatic clichemathification presents to us the situgraphic combinatory of the three possible structurations in the triolectic complementarity of this problem.

### Flambéed Toscarrot (Toscarotte flambée)

Here we are then in a position to answer the question posed an hour ago on the barbarific installation of cultural cuisine in savage nature: it concretizes itself by the foundation of an altellery touristicial where it is asked to offer the free sacrifice on the culinary office table reversed in relation to the civilitic tendency that goes from offer to demand. The potmyth of 14 A on the origin of the altelloise offering sclarifies our ideas:

**Mm 19**

*Two culinary heroes give themselves a rendezvous at the table of an altar to restore themselves there. At less than a meter's distance they face each other and order two grilled lamb tongues à la diable.*

*When the maître-autel (head waiter/master altar) brings the dish, the first hero, with a Languedocian courtological politeness, invites his friend to serve himself first. As one of the two tongues is much more voluminous than the other, the opter takes the big piece and puts it in his plate, which provokes the indignation of the polite hero who reproaches his friend for having made a mistake or for having conducted himself like a boor.*

*The other then asks him:*

*"Which tongue would you have chosen if you had served yourself first?"*

*"I would obviously have chosen the smaller one."*

*"In that case, what are you complaining about? You have exactly the tongue you would have chosen."*

*It is since that time that one no longer lets the one in charge of sharing choose.*

This potmyth calls for several marking remarks. One will first seize the concurrential diaversion in the recipiendary econoclasm of the current account of the two heroes; secondly, one will not fail to not observe the absence of a receipt that has not yet been given to them, even if they have been well received; finally, and this captivates our attention: the two heroes are brothers-in-law, which — although one does not easily deduce it from the potmyth — ties between them evident links of kinship since one is married to the sister of the other without this circumstance influencing their transactions in the least.

One is plunged into an atrocious diacordance when one observes the cultivated behavior of the tabular ritualization that undoes itself in the potmyth of tribe M on the origin of gastrohymnic ceremonies:

**Mm 20**

*In the beginning, a missionary had been received in tribe M to instruct them in good Christian morals. He was a man of elocainting speech, of a fine stature that did not fail to impress the feminine part of the tribe, which part never failed to offer itself with the best pieces of cuisine.*

*The tribe bathed in a fraternity each day more narrow and optimistic. The day came when the pampered missionary reached the weight that his cooking required.*

*A magnificent collective feast is then organized and the missionary is served all roasted on the great table, surrounded by fresh vegetables.*

*His dear brothers and sisters of the tribe kneel and, his lessons conscientiously learned, raise this prayer:*

*"Bless us, Lord, and bless at the same time the food that your liberality grants us. Amen."*

### Rice with Soprano Nose (Riz au nez soprano)

The dominant methomorphic concept — this is now beyond contention — is that of emblematology, since normaladively the note makes the heroes bleed and blanch to a hemorational point where notation and emblematic ensaignment meet. In other words, it is a matter of elaborating an emblematic of problematic and counterblematic emblems, consangsual and diasangsual of notarial bloodsuckers. It is precisely there that *occult* gastrophilia presents a natural danger that we must denounce in the name of culture. Indeed, the hero is then seized by an irresistible desire to eat *for free* (à l'œil = on the eye/for free), a vicious propensity that can only be vanquished by waving before whoever is going to yield to temptation the large repelling banner: "To yield to nature is to show oneself a bad member of society."

The emblematoire chosology of notoiral coding is established between the lord/bleeder (saigneur/seigneur) and the bled (saigné). Emblemairdish typomorphy is thus the very foundation of our melted success.

### Tripes with the Note (Tripes à la note)

The chiantific vinotruth of a raw bender thus demonstrates that the tongue is a true treasure, of a gratinéed and reciprovocant gratitude. It is in effect the very system of value of a distributation of potmythic riches, which is why it is happily called "a total social fact," that is to say endowed with a significassity at once social and religious, magical and ecological, utilitary and sentimental, juridical and moral, initiatory and denichiatory of love and hate, of marriage and divorce, of health and sickness, of pregnancy and abortion, of life and death, of all the holistic bazaar in diaversion of goods exchanged on the field of honor and error, of consumition and assumption, of commerce and the inverse, of presents and absents, without forgetting the beauty of the vanitary aesthetics of its free grace, in short on all the notes of the scale, from major to minor, of what can be made to sing according to the solfegeed note that decides the communicative notation of notarial consumption for confirmed financial purposes.

The unilateral reciprocity of this auditoreal communication depends on the possibility of managing to spin (filer) the consumative note to the gustative companion of the ceremonial festival of the restaurational meal under the title of potlatch. The success of this denotation is accompanied by a connotation if the companion is connoted enough to recognize the bill (note) to pay.

### Ventriloquist on Sofa (Ventriloque sur canapé)

The vulgarity of the tongue of the people constitutes the most redoubtable obstacle raised against a true linguocracy. The demonstration of this is delivered in a clearly democratic way by the Greek Demosthenes when he opposes savage raw to barbarian bender (cuite), the latter alone being cooked. We thus witness a situlogic parabolition between the diabolitional potmyth of the rotten pots (pots pourris) of savage cruelty and the potential infabolition of the pot-au-feu of barbarian benders put in conserve by digestive as much as congestive precaution with a discrete civicassity excellently noted by Claudius Flowerpower in the chapter on orchestrated drunksonority (ivressonorité) (p. 217) of his magisterial work *From Nougat to Rubble* (Du Nougat au Gravois), of an exemplary sobriety. His enterpropos founds the tax (impôt) in potage and the despot in compote and draws the new figure of culture which finally finds a tuna, a voice, a timbre, a brain, a head, a cerebrum, a valid paper, an écu, a gut string stretched in bilateral double on the interior bottom of the reasonable drum. We shall have the audacity to say that, for once, thanks to him, potmythology has had pot (luck).

### Fiasco da Gamba (Fiasco da gamba)

It is atrociously painful to be forced to compare this unparalleled success with the potological and muddy effort of Vitello Macchiato, so much does the latter seem, beside Flowerpower, stupid and deaf as the pot itself. And yet he is too well seated at table, sprawled at his ease among the pots and plants for us to be able to pass his case over in silence. His exceedence, already unfavorably mentioned here, obliges us, against our will, to carry the iron one last time into his potomorphic arguments.

Faced with the gravitation of this case, and in the name of scientific objectivity, we feel ourselves in conscience and to dissipate any misunderstanding around this initiation, bound to denounce the unreflected and unsubstantiated judgments of certain of our honorable colleagues, highly meritorious, who, jumping over their inestimable professional seriosity, have let themselves be carried away, by a very laudable burst of indignation, to formulate accusations more or less open on the subject of allusionary bribes (pots de vin) from which Macchiato would have benefited and characterizing him as drunk, alcoholic, cuckold, pervert, devoid of material and spiritual resources, endowed with a filthy mentality, schizophrenic, of a delirious sociomorphy, traitor, unworthy, imbecile, repugnant, intriguer, and even impotent. We esteem that it is preferable to keep silent when one finds nothing better to say about someone who belongs all the same to our confraternity.

All distances thus taken toward this saloparagmatic insultology of a purely subjectioned genre, without any probant rapport with the more or less socialomorphemere misadventures of Doctor Macchiato, we judge ourselves entitled to raise a minute crushing critique against this confrere and his outdated, erroneous, and phantasmordefunding hypertheses and to denounce his doctrine of the unijambist potmyth, formerly spread out at full length in the study by Asger Jorn appearing in 1953 under the title *The True Limping Messenger*.

We have already stigmatized Macchiato's effort to pour the bender into "drinking legs" (jambes de boire). Once on this slope, he cannot prevent himself from inventing the "leg pot" (pot de jambe). We have the duty to speak here of an outrageous sabotage of the hierarchy of high values, and all the more so since Doctor Macchiato dares to maintain that one can employ a clog (sabot) as a receptacle for these beverages in default of a boot. He falls still lower in claiming that one can bundle treasures in stockings (bas). Who would dare swear to have ever seen liquid money? He believes he is dealing us a thrust in his way in speaking to us of golden heels (talons d'or) that do not exist and he sets himself to justify his lowness by skillfully profiting from a voluptuously hazardous linguophonic coincidence thanks to which he labors to explain that the word *pote* (pal) in the Scandinavian tongue corresponds to the French potmythic pot, whereas its French correspondent is *patte* (paw) (Ger.: *pfote*) and the Scandinavian equivalent of the French word pot is, as to signification, *potte* with two t's. The macchialectical arguments in favor of such shoerial pretensions will know the free fate they deserve.


## Divertimento with Tournedos Benjamin (Divertimento au tournedos Benjamin)

Tout, suivant l'intellect, change d'ordre et de rang;  
Les Mores aujourd'hui peignent le diable blanc.

[*Translation: "Everything, according to intellect, changes order and rank; / The Moors today paint the devil white."*]

### Elegy with Cottage Cheese (Élégie au fromage blanc)

From the moment we have sumptuously exploited the relationship between the tongue and its ambiance, the moment has come to attack the nonexistent problem dear to Immanuel Kant, that of THE TONGUE IN ITSELF, its left and its right, its grandeur and its decline, its height and its smallness, its strength and its weakness.

If there exists a universal accord on the identity of the tongue and causality as caused caution, the polyversal discord is triggered on linguistic kinship as soon as one enters into detailing. There is experimental confirmation of the non-conversation of parity in weak interactions in general, which sends us into the imparietal shirage on the subject of conservatism in general. This chilarity, which goes right and left with a boiling effervescence, completely ruins the harmony of the symmetric reflection of the diametry between the left tongue and the right tongue, establishing a non-localizable complementarity between the notion of undulatory tongue and that of corpuscular tongue.

As an undulated tongue cannot (by definite) be straight (droite = straight/right), similarly a straight tongue cannot be undulated, which does not prevent the undulatory tongue from having the right to be undulated and the right tongue the right to be curved following its fidelity to Oriental parallelization, whence it emerges that the corpuscular tongue is situated at the extreme right, being statistically corpulent, whereas the current tongue of gauchist undulation is instrême.

If the linguistic corporation thus belongs to the right, linguistic undulation is nonetheless of an impressive power, were it to have nothing particulinary, which brings us to a Sunday parity since the perpendicular movement recommends that we consider the tongue as an undulation on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and as a corpuscularity on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

### Hot Jazz with Camembert (Hot jazz à la came Ambert)

The meteorological importance of this state of floating things manifests itself in the potmyth of tribe 14 A on the directorial origin of left and right.

**Mm 21**

*Under the rain, a woman soaked to the bone meets her neighbor well sheltered under an umbrella. Envidious, she asks:*

*"How is it that you always go out with an umbrella when it is going to rain and you never carry it when the weather is fine? Me, as soon as I go out with my umbrella the rain stops and the sun begins to shine and if I go out without an umbrella the good weather stops, it begins to rain in torrents, and I am sure to be soaked."*

*"Every morning," explains the neighbor, "when my husband wakes up, I look at the direction of his penile pendulum. If it points to the left, the weather will be fine; if it points to the right, it will rain. It never fails."*

*A bit disoriented and humiliated by the rapidity and precision of the reply, the neighbor asks:*

*"But is this pendulum always in direction and never in erection?"*

*"No of course not," replies the neighbor, "there are days when it is neither to the left nor to the right. That's the good moment to stay home and give him his correction. For after all, one must be direct, one cannot stroll around town and present oneself to the public in such a state!"*

### Bagpipe of Great Stilton (Cornemuse de grand stilton)

Let us mark here a pause to reflect on the signification that potmythic thought attaches to these opposed conducts.

One sees first the left tongue and the right tongue established in a codificassed meditation around a properly meteorological axis transferring itself toward the axis of the biological consequences of climate where an opposition comparable to the other by its simplicity can be reestablished at the least cost. Let us not forget in addition that this potmyth is linked on one hand to the diversion of sexes and on the other hand to the two axes of differential diametry of the vertical and the horizontal. In its still equivocal form, this transreorientalization of the vertical into horizontal can be explained in a perfectly imaginary way in the form of an opposition between the ascending tongue and the descending tongue following the contrastology between the raised tongue and the low tongue by a synchronized idachrony. A second contrast, interiorizing and redoubling all at once the first, makes of the hanged-raised couple a privileged signifier of the opposition good and male as the well-hung tongue opposes itself to the raised male tongue.

Yet, and without this having clearly appeared, we find ourselves here confronted with a curious problem. Tribe M considers that a hanged man is totally identical to a well-hung tongue, which makes it so that one obtains a well-hung tongue by hanging realized by potenced ascendance. One sees well what this implies: by ascendance the well-hung tongue is raised and the male tongue by descence is lowered, according to the desorientability of absolute zero and the rotation of the "spin" of the aleatory orientation of an elevated antrophy.

### Recitation in Brie Minor (Récitation en brie mineur)

As linguism depends on well-hung tongues, its frequency of pension and suspension is identified with *thought* (pensée) itself. Thus the thinking (pensement) of the tongue full of pendentive pendeloquence expresses itself in the potmyth of tribe 14 A on the origin of the rehanging of the hangard linguist:

[*Translator's note: Multiple puns on "pendre" (to hang), "penser" (to think), "pensée" (thought), "pendule" (pendulum), "pendu" (hanged).*]

**Mm 22**

*A priest is strolling in a wood reading his breviary. He suddenly raises his eyes and perceives the feet of a hanged linguist hero swinging at the height of his forehead. He hastens to unhook the suicide, recalls him to life, then gently reproaches him for his desperate act.*

*"What pushed you to this crime?" he asks him.*

*"Father, life was too sad."*

*"Have you tried the consolations of religion?... No?... Well, open this book, you will find words of comfort and good counsel."*

*The resurrected one opens at random and reads: "Repent" (Repens-toi).*

*He executes himself immediately, and it is since that time that linguism has abundantly re-hung itself (répendu/répandu = spread).*

[*Translator's note: "Repens-toi" (repent) sounds like "re-pends-toi" (re-hang yourself). "Répendu" (re-hung) sounds like "répandu" (spread).*]

Witness to verbalistic originality, this potmyth is equally distinguished by a ratiology so limpid that it defies all commentary, reposing in itself and for itself.

### Cantal B.W.V. 753 (Cantal B.W.V. 753)

The potmyth of 14 A on the directorial origin of left and right forms part of a homogenital group attested by a potmyth of tribe M on the origin of the snoring and ball-busted (couillonné) hero.

**Mm 23**

*A chimney sweep arrives at the home of a lady of his acquaintance, whom he has not seen for some time. He is frightened to see her face haggard, her features drawn, her eyes wild. He inquires about the motives for this lamentable state.*

*The lady tells him:*

*"Since I married this man you know, I no longer sleep; he falls asleep before me and immediately begins to snore like a chimney. I don't close an eye all night. I don't know what to do. I am desperate."*

*"Is that all?" replies the chimney sweep. "I'm going to give you some advice. As soon as he begins to snore, spread his legs wide and he will stop."*

*A week later the chimney sweep returns to the lady's to inquire about the result. He finds her reassured, her face rested and radiant.*

*She thanks him, she expresses her profound gratitude and, unable to restrain her curiosity, asks him the secret of the method.*

*"It's very simple," the chimney sweep tells her, "when you spread his legs, his balls fall and that closes the draft."*

One should not let oneself be impressed by the rationalist and functionalist deformation that this potmyth has undergone in the version presented here. The diaposition between ultraculination snorologic and infraculination ball-busted fans the opposition between the noise of the savage animal and the testiculinary seed of the vegetation of nasobemic amygdalomorphy. One thus sees appear the very image of the sedentary seducer, forming, with his spread legs, the hierarchical triangle from top to bottom on the horizontal.

We are thus capable of advancing a diastructive formality by distinction between:

| | |
|:---:|:---:|
|  | corpuscular, undulatory, animal, vegetal |
| Horizontal tongues<br>Vertical tongues<br>Horizontal and left tongue<br>Horizontal and right tongue<br>Vertical and ascending tongue<br>Vertical and descending tongue | ![](/assets/books/la-langue-verte/La20langue20verte-357.jpg) |

### Military March with Port-Salut (Marche militaire au Port-Salut)

A potmyth of tribe 14 A informs us on the origin of the attachment of the notion of good to ascendance and of the notion of evil to descence:

**Mm 24**

*Two sedenthere heroes take tea in an athegrally cultural salon.*

*The first, who is smoking a cigar, lets, through inadvertence, the ash fall into the cup of his cohero. The latter, offusthéd, insists on protesthering with these words:*

*"I prefer going up to going down."*

[*Translator's note: "Thé" (tea) is punned throughout: "sédenthères" (sedentary), "athégralement" (integrally), "offusthé" (offended), "protesthér" (protest).*]

Under several reports, this potmyth of 14 A on the origin of the conflict between tea and ash offers a remarkable character: first the vertical diatraction between high and low is here particulinarily distracted; this double-edged glossomatic linguorientation enriches itself next with a new consternation organized in a coherent system with the oppostulary theme between wax and honey thanks to the bilingualism we are going to study and which excludes all misintendances in renewing our ethnogastric demonstratification.

### Blue Bourrée of Auvergne (Bourrée bleue d'Auvergne)

As the oscillation of an undulatory tongue on the horizontal descends and rises and that of a tongue on the vertical swings from left to right, the situation is more complicated for the undulatory tongue and the clischema presented concerns directly only the corpuscular tongue. A problem on which we shall bend another time is that posed by the tongue crosswise and on the bias.

One therefore easily understands, since it is a cosmological evidence, that our desorientational conclolission represents the nail (clou) of linguophonic chretinology justified by all its nailary (clounaire) keyboard.

How can it be that a chiodogmatic impossibition of chretinilogy conforming to conclousoned symmetry is associated with the clounesque experience of oraisonnable maffiance? To resolve this difficulty, one must look closely at the potmyth of tribe M on the origin of nailical (clounique) orientation:

**Mm 25**

*Two pickle-hero (cornicheur) heroes in doubtful reciprocity, hunting one another, had framed an image with the intention of nailing it to a wall of archilogical hanging. One of them climbs the hierarchitectural ladder with a hammer and a nail. He puts the head of the nail against the wall and begins to strike on its point without managing to drive it in despite all the deployment of his striking force.*

*The hero remaining at the foot of the ladder and holding it firm observes the vain attempts of his friend and points out to him that he has the wrong nail: "Don't you see that you're using a nail structified to be planted head backwards in the opposite wall?"*

*Degusted by this Oriental criticism, the hero at the peak of his ladder is seized with worry until the moment when, to his relief, he finds in his box a nail oriented in the right direction. Thus can he execute in speed and nail sure (en clou sûr/coup sûr = for sure) his work, hang the painting on the nail and terminate the operation by nailing himself (se clouant) in the Alsatian beer.*

At first glance, one hesitates to admit that there can be striking obstrucassity in the dialogic sociophony of this potmyth. Fortunately, we are in a position to rectify this error thanks to the compartment of said potmyth with the potmyth of tribe 14 A on the origin of the crucial triangle of which we give here only an extraimely shortened extract, nanified into a little potmython:

**Mm 26**

*A crusading hero in the process of crucifying Jesus Christ is seized by a violent anger and cries out addressing the Lord: "Cross your legs, God's brothel, we only have three nails!"*

Here it is clear that the musiculinary triangle of the constructive amorphology of the trirectangular system of this structure is coincidental.

### Roquefort for Piano-Forte (Roquefort pour piano-forte)

It is necessary evidently to cut cleanly, in tongues, words by the number of three in order to sponge more easily the section by planes of a triangular parallelity along the rigolometric and painful trench, either by iron way (voix/voie ferrée = railway) or by dental way, in other words by the transfer to the transcendent, or again by transpirational and transpassioned pransaction of transperent transpiration in opposing iron to teeth and the iron tooth.

Trance being what it is, a transmitted tongue depends on its putting into trance. There would be much to say on the subject of the different diametric transmythations. We shall limit ourselves to the gastrological law that requires that a tongue be well sliced before sitting down at the table. There is reason however to distinguish between natural tongues that can only be sliced once and the cultural tongue that can be sliced and re-sliced as much as one wants since it grows back as attested by the potmyth transmitted by tribe M on the origin of the re-sliced tongue:

**Mm 27**

*A hero with a well-hung tongue is made prisoner by tongue-slicers who cut off his tongue. A little blood flows, but the hemorrhage ceases almost immediately. A sort of amnesia overtakes the hero, he has the impression of falling into sleep and he does not feel the slicing of his tongue; he barely perceives it as in a dream. And there he is speaking again without a tongue and joking, saying to one of his torturers: "Feel the terrain. Stick your hand in my throat. There, go ahead, have no fear, I won't bite it off!"*

*He is ridiculous and pitiful. They tell him: "Why feel? Your tongue, we've thrown it in the street!" And he replies: "Dogs, children of the demon! Well, let them eat them, my tongues!"*

*They had already cut off two of them and for two years he spoke as purely as with his tongue. The two years elapsed, it is another marvel: his three tongues appear in the air. He seizes one and places it in his mouth where it fixes itself. It largely surpasses the lips. It is a bit blunted, but in a very sufficient state to be sliced anew.*

Assuring the identification of the tongue with causality, this precautionary potmythology is very encouraging: it proves *that one can speak without a tongue*. Parlamentable causality here takes saucerish proportions opening a vast interplanetary perspective to the pleinarist aerolinguistic potmythology of the plantary planimetry in vertical refraction from a bird's eye view.

### Gorgon Sola Mia (Gorgon sola mia)

As the planirostry of linguisition offers neither folds nor curvatures, neither wrinkles nor undulations, aerolinguistics is obliged to remain in the domain of flying corpusculitis.

One of the most disquieting problems of the present hour, concerning exolinguistic detachment, is precisely that of flying tongues. It dominates the whole field of aerolinguistic research, the scientists not managing to identify them, even by the employment of the most radarified instrumentations.

If a tongue is a thing or a thing a tongue, to each their taste, and if a thing identifies itself by its attributes, one is condemned to remain silent on the subject of flying tongues since one knows neither to whom nor to what to attribute them and they are above everyone and everything. Even were they attached to someone or something, we would be no further advanced, this transmorphosis making it so they could no longer be characterized as flying tongues.

Certain scientists caress the hypothesis that tongues flying above someone's head could be attributed to the bearer of the overflown head. But to prove it one would need the cephalary proprietor to accept the glossary thief as attribute. Now all experiments show that one runs up against an obstacle of opinion, founded above all on the fact that a thieving tongue can fly from one head to another without absolute fidelificassion. Just as these tongues stroll about here and there and their cephaloid stationing can be the effect of pure chance or a casual caprice resultationed by a self-interest, so the over-volted head can be the unique head in the world that ignores this dessusive presence.

One thus sees that we are still far from the solution of the identification of flying tongues that confuse themselves in fusion with plates, saucers, and other culinomorphic utensils flying in the kitchen at the moment of household tempests in dramatic suspense of musiculinary aerolinguistics. The theory according to which there would not be *several* flying tongues, but they would all be *the same* tongue in permanent appearance and disappearance, obviously *identifies* it, but at the price of a complete abandonment of attribution, which is against all logic.

### Tango with Upturned Chantilly Cream (Tango à la crème Chantilly renversée)

Having established that the left tongue is not symmetric with the right tongue, we have thrown ourselves into a strangulating complicrassity, at the very moment when we want to study the tongue and its double in their reciprocessional bilaterality. Let us well understand that the bilateral tongue is the tongue that deploys itself in two opposite directions. If bilingualism had been decently polarized, one could have divided it at a right angle at 90°, but bilateralization always happens in a straight line, at 180°. We find our salvation in glossomatic zeromorphy for it is at the zero point of the telephone central that the bilateral tongue with opposite meanings divides itself.

But our salvation is only apparent, and he who believes himself out of trouble puts his finger in his eye, a perfectly vain gesture, the eye having no intellectuary importance. The gravitation of the problem lies in the fact that it is impossible to know if the bilateralization of the tongue intervened by the left or by the right, by the bottom or by the top. We therefore ignore what is first (or positive). Were it given to us to distinguish the wing of bilingualism having first or positive virtue, we could incontinently apply the negative, or second, quality to the other. Nothing then would be easier than to decide for the positive, which would give us a pro-position that would deny itself by a negation, and we would set in motion the whole train of logic. But we know many more minuses in logistologology than bilateral oppositions to which to apply the symanometry of plus and minus. The symanometry between proposition and negation does not exist. And this is very embarbassing.

The positive, from a musiculinary point of view, is a small barley buffet, ordinarily placed behind the organist or at his feet. Let us guard against drawing precipitary conclusions from this observation. We have already examined the pose: one can be pro or against, such that we can establish a pro-and-counter-position, the latter being by definite antilogical. Good, but what use can this be to us? It is now necessary to slice the position in two and retain the *sition*. We arrive at a double situation that permits us to pose our consitions facing the positions. And this time we are truly saved and we can affirm that bilingualism is *con-positional*, which — in all evidence — is useless. But in refuting functionality we have liberated ourselves from this problem, decidedly too beneath our ambitions. And there is the compotage of our bilingualism served.

### Starlet Biscuit (Vedette biscuit)

Let us come now to the enigmas of the bilingualism of honeyed tongues. There we touch on a very important point. Honeyed bilingualism is for us the fundamental problem of linguistic apiculture, in that it raises the allophonic struction of aligned words to the level of crosswords. To the plane of the square circle is thus added the tridemental perspective of the cubic sphere.

It is to the illustrious "Bilinguistic Circle of Copenhagen," honored with a subsidy, that goes the merit of a brilliant and exact description of the bicubic model of bilingualism in a cubic sphere. One finds it in the already classic treatise *Lingvistisk Kubistik contra Bikubisk Bistik*, translated into the Italian tongue under the title *Sulla bisticcatione linguistica*. The reader is urgently requested to study the eighteen pages of this work that bring a precious contribution to the sinking of the bisticological and apipunctural problem.

For the first time is there explained and proved the absolute identity of bilingualism, or more precisely of the bilingual, with the language of bees. Indeed, bee is said *bi* in the Scandinavian tongue (in English *bee*), and it is the beehive which, because it is round, is called *bicube*. This aspect of the question is treated in infinitely cavernous potmythic depth by Albert Sandklef in his book *Äldre biskötsel i Sverige och Danmark* (Kungl. Vetenskaps och Vitterhets-Samhälles Handlingar. Göteborg. V. fd. Serie A. Bd 6, nr. 3, p. 157, chap.: "Bin och honung i ordspråk, talesätt, och gåta") where is proposed this potmyth in the form of a very enigmatic popular riddle:

**Mm 28**

*Next to my house, there is a little house. Inside they saw. Inside they piss, and inside the peasant dips his bread. Who are the inhabitants of this house?*

[*Translator's note: The answer is bees — they "saw" (buzz), they "piss" (produce honey), and the peasant dips his bread in their honey.*]

In his savory book *The Abbess and Her Candle*, the Viennophile symbologist Ostrich Levalseur (Autruche Levalseur) labors to demonstrate that the inhabitants can only be the bees, thus resolving at the same time the problem of the spheric cube. The author arrives at an irrefutable conclusion by administering the proof of the identity of the *abbot* (abbé) and the *bi-skop* (bishop), proof that he solidly seats on the opposition between wax and honey. Wax is combustible, while honey is comestible, according to the formal formulette formulated by Russian formulism which, by diarevolution, transpierces the monologue into biologue. The revolution acting as lost wax, since candles give way to electric lighting, one can speak of sad wax (triste cire/tristesse = sadness) as candle and masculine and oppose it to honey which is feminine, dear (cher), and lunatic (in English: dear honey; in French: honeymoon at the concierge's).

### Strawberry Oboes (Fraises hautbois)

The notion of binary tongue still broods a third problem worthy of intestinal hatching. It concerns the diaposition between language and the fork. The glossomorphile pertinence of tongues, which have a tendency to fork (fourcher = to make a slip of the tongue/to fork), supposes the simultaneous use of a bilateralization with double meaning, which is frequent among vipers. In his study on glossomatic diaforking, the polyconnerologue Marcel Havrenne observes: "When the tongue forks, the devil is not far," which projects lively gleams on the state of words.

That is not all. By means of idiolectical aristotelescopy, one has had the happiness of discovering an interdependence between the fork and the teeth. At the extreme, a forked tongue can be tridentary. This case is however rather rare, but then the man becomes a good fork (une bonne fourchette = a hearty eater).

The fork with multiple teeth equals the comb. It transforms itself without difficulty into a comb; and, in this state, it is very useful to the hairy tongue, all the more so that afterward it can be eaten. Certain people even prefer combs (peignes) to oysters, it's a question of taste. Assuredly, the comb makes the glossoror's hair stand on end.

On the gnoseontological plane, the bilingual of sacred bees consequently symbolizes BEING in its plenitude. The immortal hamlet-sad maxim convinces us of this: "To bee or not to bee" (English version).\*

*(\*) See also Lord Drone of Queensbury (Hecatombs of Honeycombs, C.U.P., 1931, p. 111): "To quote a noted mellifactor, Olaus Magnus: Near a beehive it behoves you to beehive yourself... and let us bear in mind the dichotomy between the notions to bee and to hive."*

It is a rather curious fact that doubled bilinguals, in becoming bi-binary, can, by their bad vintages (mauvais crus), provoke benders (cuites) offensolemnly hostilized of which the apipunctual bilinguals acting against the bibironnated and bibitary rotguts (bibines) are victims.


## Finale with Nun's Farts (Finale aux pets de nonne)

[*Translator's note: "Pets de nonne" are a type of French pastry (fried choux puffs).*]

Questa é la danza del Serpente  
Che viene giu dal monte,  
Per incontrare la sua coda,  
Che ha perso un di.

Ma guarda un po,  
Sei proprio tu,  
Quel pezzetino  
Del mio codino.

[*Translation from Italian: "This is the dance of the Serpent / Who comes down from the mountain, / To meet his tail, / That he lost one day. // But look a bit, / It's really you, / That little piece / Of my little tail."*]

Italian children's round.

### Pear with Clarinet (Poire à la clarinette)

In spite and in debit of certain recoveries, what one would like to call the points of semantic equilibrium of tongues are differently placed: certain tongues are above all laudative and fall under eulogical glossophilia; others are rather deprecatory and express themselves by illogical lingophobia. Several glossophobic potmyths offer themselves to our disproportion, in varied variations; we begin with the potmyth of tribe 14 A on the origin of tongue maladies:

**Mm 29**

*Paolo Uccello is in the process of fighting in the midst of a vast mental tissue where he has lost all the routes of his soul and even the form and the suspension of his reality.*

*Quit your tongue, Paolo Uccello, quit your tongue, my tongue, my tongue, shit, who is speaking, where are you? Wineskin, wineskin, Spirit, Spirit, fire, tongues of fire, fire, fire, eat your tongue, old dog, eat your tongue, eat, etc. I tear out my tongue.*

*...It concerns a problem posed to the spirit of Antonin Artaud, but Antonin Artaud has no need of a problem, he is already bothered enough by his own thought, and among other facts of having encountered himself in himself, and discovered himself a bad actor, for example yesterday, at the cinema, in Surcouf, without furthermore this larva of Little Paul coming to eat his tongue in him.*

*...There is a plan for Paolo Uccello, and a plan for Brunelleschi and Donatello, and a little plan for Selvaggia, Paolo's wife.*

*Two, three, ten problems have intercrossed all of a sudden with the zigzags of their spiritual tongues and all the planetary displacements of their plans...*

Another variant of this potmyth, largely spreadtended in tribe M, reheats our understanding:

**Mm 30**

*The tongue is a little member, and it boasts of great things. Behold how a little fire can kindle a great forest. The tongue also is a fire; it is the world of iniquity. The tongue is placed among our members, defiling the whole body and inflaming the course of life, being itself inflamed by Gehenna. All species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and marine animals are tamed and have been tamed by human nature; but the tongue, no man can tame it; it is an evil that cannot be repressed: it is full of a mortal venom, and if the tongue cannot tame man, it can in any case eliminate him, which is done.*

[*Translator's note: This is a parody/variation of the Epistle of James 3:5-8.*]

In this variant, one will note an accentuary repugnation. All this may seem supernofficially dejectural and sepulcrative. One would be wrong however to stay at an impression a bit too pastive. Cuisine must be taken literally (éprise/prise), whether it be sad or gay, beautiful or ugly according to its humor. Thus literary lettry represents for the illiterate a sacred lecheture gourmandoline of audioglossometry. Let one kindly become conscious of the hierarseismography of the sacred lechtion in the interval of the intellect and the extellect and one will luminously perceive that idiolechture dia-and-triolechtical opposes itself to the masculine field of the lickwell (lèchebien) and the feminine field of the lickbian (lèchebienne = lesbian), thus concretizing the animalversion between the tongue in heat and the hunted tongue that hunts the tongue-hunter. This is what marvelously emerges from the potmyth M on the origin of the inextinguishable smile of which we give the essangieal extracts:

**Mm 31**

*The lechetor hero in eatall (mangetôt) prepares himself for impious struggle with courange. A lamp and a tongue that form a single body, that is what one does not see ofange. He recognizes the form of the lamp; he recognizes the form of the tongue; but he cannot split them in his mind; in effect, in reality, they are glued one into the other... The lechetor in eatall, while he receives cruel wounds with an invisible sword, strives to bring closer to his mouth the figure of tongue. She struggles no more than feebly and one sees the wordeat (motmange) where her adversary will be able to embrace her at his ease, if that is what he wants to do. Well then, the wordeat has come. With his muscles, he estranges the throat of tongue, which can no longer breathe, and turns her facange over, pressing it against his odious chest.*

*It is done; something horrible is going to enter the camp of the Ganges. He pends himself and carries the tongue, soaked with his lip, on that languelic pout that casts supplicanting looks. He walks his tongue some time on that pout. Oh!... see!... just see!... the whange and pink pout has become black, like a chestnut! She exhaills putrid miasmas. It is langraine; it is no longer permitted to squint at it. The gnawing evil extanges itself on all the figure, and from there, furiously excites the lower parts; soon, the whole body is only an ugly cow (vache laie/laide = ugly). He himself, appwalld (épouvangé) (for he did not believe that his tongue contained a poison of such violange), bashes the lamp and gets full of it. Once outside, he runs like an insane through the streets, heads toward the stage and langes the lamp over the jump seats. It swirls for some instanges, and definitively sinks into the muddy waters. Since that day, every evening, at nightfall, one sees a brilliant lamp that surges and maintains itself, gracefully, on the surface of the river, at the height of Leo's pot, carrying in place of angel (ange), two cute little tongues. Its white-like-electric-light fluors frighten the belles of the guys who lange the two shores, and between which she advances like a queen, solitary, impenetrable, with an inextinguishable smile, without her oil spreading with bitterness. At the beginning, the water rats hunted her, but she thwarted these vain efforts, escaped all pursuits, by planching, like a coquette, and reappeared, farther away, at a great distange. Now, the supersyphilisititious sailors, when they see her, râle toward an opposed erection and hold back their slippers.*

This potmyth, of which we have retained only the sole aspects directly interesting our dialysis, reflects the lechetorl effect of a hard tongue on a soft object: it leaves there its gestatory trace, in digestion with the effect of the hard object on the soft tongue. This view finds itself reinforced by the potmyth of tribe 14 A on the origin of the digité of the clean tongue:

**Mm 32**

*A weasel introduces herself one day into the workshop of a blacksmith. Perceiving there a file, she begins to lick it, so well that by dint of rubbing her tongue on it, it loses much blood. And the weasel licks the blood with delight, believing it comes from the iron, until she has no more tongue.*

There evidentiarily exists a relation of correlation and opposition between the lamp and the tongue, in diastruction with the opposition between the file and the blood. This diaversion with double meaning takes on a major importance and will retain us longer than the preceding ones.

### Pie with Laughter (Tarte à la rigolade)

Despite everything, the avalentary and inavalentary glossociety still engirdlures a final emblematic problem that makes any langueur blench by its linguomorphic profoundamentality: it is the problem of the automobiliary swallowtrance of one's own tongue. We are catapulted toward this ultimate possibility because of the exhaustion of all the others.

As soon as we are miserabiliariously reduced to contenting ourselves with our own tongue, the situation complexuses itself. We shall begin by establishing that *one cannot swallow one's own tongue if it is not clean (propre)*. How shall we manage to dent this problem? We need, to resolve it, a souder (solder) soutired from the hygienary glossaturation of auto-propriety, in echo to recipetation R 8 of tribe 14 A on the raw tongue. A dirty tongue is not clean and if our own tongue escapes our property, it is not clean either. There's the hic. This is what explhics, with exquisite words, the Exquimo Abrh.-Isaac Jacobson when he specifies that the private tongue does not exist, except if one is deprived of the tongue, and that, in this case even, the private tongue is langusting inexistence.

### Banana for a Deceased Child (Banane pour un enfant défunt)

After our energetic work to the effect of reuniting scattered laws in a code, we have figured this contradance in tail (queue), which necessitates the codificassion of the tongue (from the Italian: *coda* = tail) or caudificassion (from the Latin: *cauda*), as one wrote before the reform of orthography.

It is precisely at the moment when he eats his own tongue that the problem of the middle and the end begins to topsy-turvy the researcher for the meanant (moyennante) tongue is here the meaned (moyennée) tongue and autojustificassity implies beginning by the end that justifies the middle opposing the beginning of the end to the end of the beginning. One thus understands by where one must begin to finish with one's own tongue. The semential relation between sementor and seed is here sown partouze in the dementic system, which imposes the holistic solution, alone apt to settle the affair in guaranteeing us the totality of the succession. Thus *one eats oneself entirely* beginning with the tail which becomes the culinary source of the potmythility of the pure tongue. This is the landed object of the desputes between the M potmyths and the 14 A potmyths on the sourciary originality of head to tail, supported on the well-known desputain questioning schema: *Which was there first, the tail or the head?*

This disputic problem posed, which opposes our two supposed tribes, where tribe M claims that the tail as end is at the origin of the head as beginning, tribe 14 A insists on the disposition according to which common eating (mangement en commun), which is commondeating (commangement/commandement = commandment), represents the musiculinary *origin*, whereas the tail comes in tail computaine. We are, in these conditions, held to rely on ageological agitation to see clearly. Ageological ancestronomy, which opposes the aged to the non-aged, permits acting ageologically. Ancestral agization justifies itself as middle of the Middle Ages by means of the remedionist mediadamnation of normative and statist average, zootyme as well as botyme.

### English Compote (La compote anglaise)

The renaiscensible remedieval evaluation of the sourciary origin of the stubborn tail sends back the forked penis, particularly apt to engender twins, to its sole acceptable explanation, that of its identity with the tongue that forks, which confirms the prehistoric potmyths of the languishing tail and the querellary and belliqueue tongue. *Fine and well* (Bel et bien) thus establishes itself by a desputain juxtaposition of chthonifying origin, in a way upside down on the horizontal.

A first hypothesis presents itself, which it is fitting to eliminate. The prehistorians esteem that imputan disputation remains computatory, in relative rapport with the purity of their own tongue, by virtue of the rule that wants "for the pure all is pure" and "for the impure all is impure," a magiological and antiscientific formula inspired by the possible interest of the non-interested who renders each proprietor improper by definiciability. This touches on the untouchable science of puromania in puree. One observes that the puristic method of an appropriated tongue is a putitainified false offspring to which one can make renaissensible reproaches, so much is it evident that there are not thirty-six solvable solutions for hydrolinguistic liquidation.

These explanations are furnished by way of commentary to a myth M, of a prestalinified significassity, on the origin of postal lechture denouncing the dysculinary origin of bad cuisine.

**Mm 33**

*A hunter hero was traversing the mountainous and deserted forest. His dog accompanied him. He had hunted from sunrise until dusk without having taken the least nourishment. He suddenly perceives a cabin that a sign designates as a hospice for hungry hunters.*

*He enters with his dog into a small empty room and sits down on a chair. A man comes out of the kitchen and asks him if he wants to eat. Yes, says the hero who, as nothing else is offered to his choice, decides on the dish of the day. The man returns to his kitchen where he busies himself for some moments, then he returns bearing a mound defying analysis that he deposits before the starving hero.*

*Barely has the hero taken a mouthful of the dish than he feels a violent urge to vomit. The dish has an immonde taste. As his dog, tortured by hunger, stirs at his feet, the hero places the dish on the ground and lets the dog empty it. As soon as the dog has finished his meal, the hero puts the empty plate back on the table.*

*At this moment the cook who had returned to his stoves and had seen nothing of the maneuver casts a worried glance through the half-open door. When he perceives the empty plate he comes back into the room and says with pride: "You've finished everything, you liked it, huh?"*

*The hero looks at him calmly and replies: "No, I didn't like it, it was inedible. I gave it to my dog, he ate it, and look at the poor beast now, he's licking his ass to remove the bad taste from his mouth."*

*It is since that time that hunters always carry in their haversack sumptuous foods and beverages when they go hunting in the mountainous and deserted forests.*

Although obscure, this potmyth offers a particulinary interest. Let us try to advance a meal by confronting the repassed with the repassoir of repassing. We see the purificassity of the behind debouching on the gastrological tongue in removing the bad taste from the front to arrive at autorottening by culistic analogement, at the inverse of the recipetation of the tribe 14 A of reformatory tradition.

### High-Fidelity Lollipop (Sucette haute-fidélité)

Thus the belt of the beginning of the end buckles by a contrastructed antagonization between the two tribes on the subject of the *politure* (polishing) of their own tongues. Acting by pure politeness, the M savages put themselves in linguistic diametry in relation to the pure politics of the 14 A savages.

The police question of this polished tongue introduces us here into full politics. But since the Hellenaire origin of polipotmythology is incontestably Greek, we find there the proof that the politechnics of the politological rascal (polisson) rests on a purely poliarchitectonic foundation, which leads us a bit too far.

It is better to stop there, and that is indeed what we have decided to do from the moment the qualitative querellation of our little quelconque querimony begins to become inquétant for the questure.

At first sight, this seems easy. A group of potmyths on the origin of the abandoned hero comes however to trouble this beautiful perspective. Let us study its variable version in tribe M:

**Mm 34**

*Two hunter heroes carry with them a respectable load of provisions completed with a dozen liters. After one or two singynegetical exploits, hunger gnaws at them and they free themselves of their heavy load by making a most heavy and solid meal.*

*Then they resume their chasterial road. After a few steps, one of the heroes, by reason of accelerated digestion, is seized by the pressing urge to relieve himself of the oppressing surplus of his compressing merdological volumation.*

*His friend, breathing his intentions, protests: "Wait a bit until we arrive in a more tranquil place. Don't you see it's swarming with vipers here. It's too dangerous."*

*The other, under high emotive pressure, only applies to the face of his friend the religious word of Cambronne, and doesn't do one or two: he lowers his trousers and squats to execute his duty.*

[*Translator's note: "The word of Cambronne" is "Merde!" (Shit!), famously attributed to General Cambronne at Waterloo.*]

*Barely has he preluded with a few flatuosities than he straightens up and lets out an atrocious howl: "I've been bitten!"*

*The other hero, seeing his cohero twisted with pain, asks him if he feels capable of going to the next village. No, he cannot, his state worsens from minute to minute. Then, the friend runs, distraught, to seek help.*

*He arrives at the village, but the doctor is in the process of saving the life of a twelve-year-old damsel who prides herself on a miscarriage and he cannot abandon his partouzurient. Moreover, he has no antivenomous products. "You have only one thing to do," he explains, "return to your friend, incise the bite with a knife and suck until the venom is entirely extracted."*

*The hero returns, at full legs, to his heroic partner and asks him:*

*"Where were you bitten?"*

*"On the penis, sacred name of a hunting dog!"*

*"That was what I feared," says then the helper hero. "In that case, there is nothing to be done. The doctor said it was hopeless."*

*It is since that time that heroes go to the toilet before leaving for the hunt, preferring among all for hydrophilic reasons the flush (chasse d'eau = hunt of water).*

### Pie with Gong (Tarte au gong)

The hierarchological aboutismation of this last potmyth tends toward a herological supremastification of hydrolinguism placed at the elementoreal summit. This gives us cause for reflection.

From this promontory, we see apparently open a new conclounical panoramic prospection of the cloturial aspect of our incomplete lingothèque. And yet we must, more than ever, arm ourselves with an extreme reserverbality toward hasty fermentations.

At this crossroads of the good term of our determineral extermination, founded on a consommeilled disjoncturalism, it emerges from our barathèmes, in all conscience, that we are running by chance behind a logical approach with ruts systematically pretraced nowhere.

Our modesty, universally recognized, authorizes us to proclaim the landing, thanks to our imageniality, of a new science, the only one in the world and which can only be nomenclotured under the exterminist term *of utopology*.

The reason for this success resides in the utopia of our subject, nonexistent as object. Thus the World is only a newspaper that remakes itself every day, and our study has not taken place nor even half-place. Our reader has understood that, since the first lines of this book, we are pleading for the situgraphie of the non-place.

**Dal capone al fine**

[*Translator's note: A pun on "Da capo al fine" (from the beginning to the end), replacing "capo" (head/beginning) with "capone" (capon/big head).*]


## Postlude with Fine Champagne (Postlude a la fine champagne)

Avec moi dieu-le-chien et sa langue  
qui comme un trait perce la croûte  
de la double calotte en voûte  
de la terre qui le démange.

Sous les seins de la terre hideuse  
dieu-la-chienne s'est retirée,  
des seins de terre et d'eau gelée  
qui pourrissent la langue creuse.

[*Translation: "With me god-the-dog and his tongue / which like a stroke pierces the crust / of the double vaulted skullcap / of the earth that itches him. // Under the breasts of the hideous earth / god-the-bitch has withdrawn, / breasts of earth and frozen water / that rot the hollow tongue."*]

Antonin Artaud.

### Trombone Tail (Codi di tromba)

In thus cooking the tail of this book, in direct rapport with its vertical trait and in its attachment to all the modern figures of musiculinary value, apart from the round and the maxim, we know that no one is more embarrassed than he who holds the tail of the potmythic frying pan. We hope however, tail taking, to return with the tail between the legs (its preferred endroitation) without being spoken to too much of the wolf wolf leu making the queue (faire la queue = to queue up/to follow in line like a wolf).

Now that our musiculinary concert touches on its end, we understand that this consistant end does not exist, since one passes incontinently from the concert to the dessert, which encloses itself in the particulinary struction from which it flows that the proper of this improper and yet puerile book is to have neither subject nor object. In anagogical terms, it has neither commondeating (commangement) nor end (faim/fin = hunger/end); one can therefore commondeate it anywhere, were it by the end (faim), so much does it prove that it would have developed in an analogous and conologous manner if its phonemathological point of departure had been taken elsewhere in the dispersonnalized unity of our culinomorphic dynamythology.

Cloturological terminology, in enlightening the butology of our teleology, informs us that the latter has no more end, the exit being made by the dessert opposite to the entry which is in concert. After having opposed our service of cuisinial listening table to the end of the height, we desire that our lecheators not succumb under the cucumbrating weight of our encumbering cuisine.

Someone will perhaps judge bouleversing, or even revolting, this militant march that revolues itself like a voluminous wheel. Now we have designated the place where this bouleversement puts itself in a squarely cooked ball: in our potmythic saucepan at the bottom of which primary materialism decomposes to the profit of a concerted mush whence exhales the aroma of the olfactic codifricassity of our preferred dish in the name of whom we wish a good appetite scientifically elogical to all those who aspire to it.

### Soufflé with Honeyed Trumpinette (Soufflé a la trompinette mielleuse)

From the fact that our study has neither beginning nor end, one would be wrong however to infer that it has neither tail nor head. Quite the contrary, we have striven to put the tail at the head and to have the tail suckled by the head, putting the lecheator head to head with the mythification of the stubborn tail and the encularded head, consequently to the march of a glossophile thought that surpasses itself to arrive at the immaculate and antisceptic conception of an inconceptible new world of franchised concepts defining themselves without end and freely by themselves according to their autoconceptional affinities and where the amorphonic incompatibilities they manifest vis-à-vis one another, in the identical archivolture of the spirit beyond images, still adhere to the concrete experience of the ideological abstraction of the external world that concludes itself in the internat.

### Sigh in Gelatine (Soupir en gélatine)

When we consider under such an angle this text of an indigestible and confusionaire taste, we begin to doubt that the public will draw from it the impression of draining a musiculinary work, such as the dishes and plans and one and the other titled of the chapters tend to present it to them. But after having drawn up this disabused observation, may it at least be permitted to us, by way of scientific consolation, to caress the objective hope that the lecheator, once having crossed the limits of arrangement and the boredom of our flexions and reflections, may be, by the hungry movement that will distance him from this book, transported in hunger (faim/fin = end), with good appetite, toward the potmyths of the glosseurous musicuisine. If after this disgusting degustation, he has difficulties in closing his belt, we invite him to tighten it, as the state council of serial dynamythologies that already girdle him commands. Afterward, he will only have to button it (la boucler = to shut up).

From prima veraboard, when one projects a study like this one, one imagines that the cuisine of the tongue is the simplest affair in the world. You have experienced with us, flesh lecheators, the diffuse confusion where we infuse. Better than anyone, that is to say better than nothing, since we know that no one exists, we have a clear scientific conscience of the propositional acceptions accepted that we have inoculated into some dérivisionist terms here and there, thus: dysmorphosology, absurdirectionism, phonemathology, disparallelism, situnomy, dia-and-con-structurationalism, etc. We have used them to designify big packets of relations of which we confusedly and diffusely perceive that they possess some insignificances in common. As light as this book may be, it is only a tiny bit of the tongue, for which one will perhaps pardon us, in regard to our profession of scientific humility, for having naively pulled, for our joy, lengthwise and widthwise.

The illuminations being quantitatively encumbering in this book, we find ourselves obliged to declare the following:

We regret having had to call upon the Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism: this organism, lamentably disorganized, has shown itself incapable of furnishing the precise references of most of the documents coming from its anarchitectonic archives.

On the other hand, it is agreeable to us to tip our hat to M. François Mathey, chief curator of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, who introduced us to the impeccable services of the photographic archives of the Monuments Historiques whose amability and diligence are one of the curiosities of the modern world.

It similarly pleases us to salute M. Michel Leiris, director at the Musée de l'Homme, who guided us in the excavations of his services with science and good humor.


## Exhaustive Bibliography (Bibliographie exhaustive)
