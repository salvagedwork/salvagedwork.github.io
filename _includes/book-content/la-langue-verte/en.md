## Prelude with Fine Herbs

### Homage to the American Style

The book you are about to enjoy here on the cooking of languages is the first of its kind. This surprising fact finds its explanation in the obstacle, insurmountable until now, posed by the cultic enigma of personality. Strictly personal, this book obviously does not exist, since by definition what does not exist is nobody and nobody can exist at present.

However, the dazzling progress of the new scientific zeromorphy has allowed us to resolve this delicate problem through the implementation of a largely computational non-technique, necessary for the glutosonorous struction of our ethnogastric diamarch.

Having thus amply satisfied our auditory thirst at the good sources flowing from the lost source, and happily rediscovered by today's men of science, we seized the opportunity to draw from first-growth sources already cooked from the art of tomorrow.

We can only express our deepest recognition and gratitude to all those who have shown a gracious mythophonic attitude, and moreover a gratuitous one, of a savoury poetic, human and learned fecundity. We particularly thank the Gotiska Gastrophilselskabets Generalurskottet of Stockholm, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, the Cave Coopérative de Vinification de Labastide-de-Lévis (Tarn), the Department of Culinary Arts at the Museum of Modern Art in New York...
