The issues also included essays on art theory, non-Western artefacts, literature, poetry, film, architecture, and photography, as well as exhibition reviews and profiles of contemporary Danish artists. <em>{{ page.title }}</em> was named for the three-legged horse associated with Scandinavian mythology that symbolised death and illness.
