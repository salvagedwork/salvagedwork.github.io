A whole universe of images of a particular character has quietly crossed time, on the walls of the churches of Normandy. And yet it was subject to perpetual development and enrichment. It was evoked by an artist with an alert gaze, who now communicates it to us. These strange signs and images, executed and known only by the local population, are thus in these pages exposed to the attention of a wider public, in other countries.

An abundance of signs and symbols is spread out on these stone surfaces, and precisely because these drawings are not the work of a single hand from a specific period, but represent the activity of a multitude, from ancient times to the present day, each surface blends into a very lively unity, in which nature also participates through its play of colours with the grey-brown-yellow of the lichen flowers.

It is impossible to date the first images. Even if we can date, with relative precision, the many churches, castles and farms, where the picture stones can be found, the fact remains that for some of them, the place they currently occupy may only be their second use, their origin being in places of worship several millennia old. Such practices are well known. This mainly concerns stones with cup-shaped hollows, as they are arranged on the first pages: freely sowed, or in straight lines, circles, rectangles and other geometric shapes that may represent men as well as animals. This symbol is known all over the world, in its highest antiquity. It can be followed up to five thousand years in the past, in the same material and character that we find here. These holes dug in the rock are still today the object of cultural practices at the foot of the Himalayas, where women bring their offering of yellow flower chalices to ensure, by means of this symbol of the female sex, fertility and happiness.

The cupuliform hollows seem to follow the ancient cultural communication route that continues from the Middle East, across the Mediterranean and along the coasts of western Europe, to the Nordic countries attached to a particular fertility cult. This cult had succeeded in subjugating this immense domain from the third millennium B.C. until the end of the first millennium of the present era.

In the west of France, this sign is attached, among others, to the magnificent stone tombs of the Gulf of Morbihan in Brittany, which are from the second millennium. It is also found on the stone of menhirs forming huge processional paths, such as the alignments of Kermario. Several of the stones reproduced here could be taken from similar places; in the same way that in Denmark we often find old stones - with cupuliform hollows - reused in the construction of thresholds, or as bases (see No. 6).

We do not know until what time this sign retained its magical power, but it is also found, reproduced in large numbers, on the stones of the steps of the famous temple of Athena, on the Acropolis of Athens, traced long after the temple was completed. Nowadays, it can be seen being used for games, all around the Persian Gulf, and also in other places. This does not prevent it from having other, more ancient meanings for the people of these regions; but it does imply a problem of the ritual role that the ancient games may have played in divination.

The cup-shaped hollows are, in the whole of the Mediterranean area, Western European and Northern European, related to the old cult of Mother Earth. A long series of signs: circles around holes, a wheel with a cross, hollows and extended circles of rays, etc., were used for divination. (numbers from 16 to 30), however, is centred on the forces of heaven, a cult that penetrated with peoples on horseback who invaded northern and central Europe about 4,000 years ago. From that time, and in the following few millennia, these two religions, that of heaven and that of earth, meet and refract themselves in the art of images, and give it its content. We find this art on the megalithic monuments, both in the Gulf of Morbihan and in Eastern Ireland, where we can find all the hollows, circles and other signs that are in this book. Even though the circular sign, in its many variants, appears to be related to the power of the sun, it is no less likely that it should be considered, in some cases, as the eye that watches over the mother goddess.

The same connection with a fertility cult that has continued to this day is also reflected in many other images in this book. This is the case with many footprints, single or double, which are often combined, in western and northern Europe, with cross-sectional hollows. This sign, together with that of the sun, can be traced through the entire Iron Age, up to the Christian period (numbers 68 and 74). The many sacred footprints on the rocks and stones of India are attributed to Buddha or Vishnu, but in many places there are old traditions that attribute to the footprints of the human foot a beneficial, fertilizing, productive power. It is the same case with the shoe, known as such in Greek culture, among others. This tradition survives until our times, in the habit of attaching a shoe to the bride and groom's car. We can see shoe prints with the heel (number 73) and the shoe itself (number 75). The type of this shoe belongs to the XVI-XV centuries, which indicates the date of its execution. In general, the foot as a symbol of power as well as the hand (numbers 78 to 82), protects against evil forces and acquires, through magical rites, divine power that spreads to the place where it was drawn.

The horse, this marvellous animal, belongs to the powers of heaven. It arrived from the steppes of Asia at the end of the third millennium B.C., as a draught animal, as a mount, and as a dairy animal. Its image is powerful, and causes fertility (numbers 107 to 112). He pulls the sun behind him through the sky, he is bound to fire. Thus was attached to the god of fertility, in Nordic paganism, a trait that manifests itself to us with the horse-shaped corvette, in the vicinity of Lille. Both the image of the deer (numbers 95 to 102) and that of the bird (numbers 61 to 66) fall into the same category.

There are a series of all-sail boats out there, some of which could be made by our grandparents (numbers 40 to 48), and some older ones. All of them recall the nave of the church and the carnival boat. The boat itself belonged, three thousand years ago, to the god of fertility in the Middle East, in Greece (the boat of Dionysos), and in the North where fertility rites were inseparable from popular parades with boats. This transport of ships is still known today, especially in carnival parades, even if its original purpose has been forgotten. In Normandy, however, it seems that memories of antiquity have been kept in the back of people's minds.

Several subjects confirm the coexistence of these images with the official Christian culture. The superb cathedrals and modest places of prayer (numbers 158, 62), the church bells (number 176), the tombstone (number 137), the keys of St. Peter's (number 83) and the ladder of heaven (number 116). In Viking times, a thousand years ago, the key was the sign worn around the neck, in silver or bronze, as a sign of attachment to the Christian belief; others, however, wore the sign of the hammer to show their fidelity to the ancient powers of heaven (it is difficult to know whether the numbers 194-196 should be interpreted in this way). Even though Christianity apparently reigned on the surface of the country, it appears that much older beliefs dominate the world of images shown here. This is not a unique case, and all those who visit the charming Frascati, in Monti Albani, south of Rome, can still today bite into the figurines of the three-breasted women that are sold in the small bakers' shops, a present testimony of the ancient goddess of fertility: Astarte, Aphrodite or Ava, or some other name that was given to the Magna Mater, the mother of origins.
