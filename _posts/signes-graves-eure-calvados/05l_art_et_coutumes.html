Dumézil criticizes northern archaeologists for classifying myths according to an exaggeratedly chronological method and order, but his classification - based on hierarchical value judgements - does not seem to me to be much more advantageous. For, in Scandinavian countries, the different myths are superimposed, in different colours, but in a whole where the central themes reappear permanently.

It should be known that the assimilation of the conquering Streitaxvölker peoples, the "battle-axe", was at the origin of the conflict between Aesir and Vanes, and, as a second consequence, the halt, in Scandinavia, of all stone construction - that, until the Romanesque period, in the 11th century.

By creating a centralization of savings, the material localization of wealth in urban centers and especially in churches broke, in our opinion, the original power of the farmers.

Products of art and civilization, the objects locked up in churches and tombs were removed from the customary circuit of consumption. A problem arose, a sort of agrarian problem, of putting these values back into play. Graffiti is an example of an attempt to resolve it. They demonstrate and express opposition to this systematized saving, which was, in fact, a halt to production and consumption and a hindrance to civilization.

Where and when should works of art be protected, and against whom?

The civilizing, social and political activity - in the form of the creation of states, the drafting of laws, the building of cities, was regarded with horror by the Scandinavian peasant-warriors, as a giant's work - of jaete. This affectivity prevented them from developing a civilization in which the city would have played its role.

These jaetes were poorly rewarded: 'Having become Christians and Catholics, they erected a Church of builders whose power was so great that for a long time it was able to forbid the entry of Copenhagen to the very king of Denmark at any time. But these jaetes were finally completely excluded from Nordic social life.

It is necessary to know the harmful importance of the spirit of opposition to the union of the Aesir and the Vanes and to know that their difficulties were caused above all by the spirit of city life and civility.

The word "Vane" expresses both habit and dwelling, worship and home (all.: gewohnheit-wohnung). It thus designates an element of stability in two different forms in Time by tradition and in Space by place. All that this word manifests of a desire for permanence, conservation and maintenance is categorically opposed to "play", to changing customs, to fashion. This desire for permanence and this concern for stability - forged over the centuries in the depths of the Nordic soul - cannot be changed.

Criticizing Nordic art, Benedetto Croce asserts (in an easy pastiche of Buffon's famous sentence: "Style is the man") that "style is not the woman". False subtlety of a typically and fiercely Latin spirit, which we do not see at all that it really calls into question Nordic art. Let us leave aside Socrates quoted by P.M. Mollet ("Only boys are interested in style, adult men are no longer interested in it") and let us only remember that Croce's statement tends to establish that Nordic expressionism is feminine because its spontaneity is a negation of style. Femininity and spontaneity: here we are with Croce in full Latinity! Fashion is women, not men.

Undaunted by style, Nordic artists have created an Experimental Art that the Cobra formula illustrates quite well. Modern Art is opposed to this no less free than liberated art. Capital antagonism. The title of Paolo Marinotti's study on the programme of Palazzo Grassi in Venice seems to us to indicate - and in a central way - where the heart of the problem lies in Art today.
