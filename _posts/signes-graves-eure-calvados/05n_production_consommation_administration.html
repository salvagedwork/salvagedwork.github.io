*To consume is to happen.*

The most important antagonism in economic structures seems to be the problem of causality in the relationship between production and consumption: do we create in order to consume or do we consume in order to create? Which of these two activities is a function of the other? And once this mystery is cleared up, will we know more about the authority behind the administrative power, and even more about who is responsible for it?

We have already indicated that the events of economic reality are ordered in very different series according to the three areas of European culture in which they occur.

For the Nordic minds, the very importance of the link they establish between the past and the present distracts them from any event or manifestation that is purely topical. They would, by way of exception, want to focus their attention on such an event that they could not help but draw to it whatever they saw as being part of it in the past - it being understood that the more distant past will also be called upon to provide information.

Traditionally we see destruction and death, the end, as a passage to the past. The difficulty with this attitude is that it cannot be said that every complete process, in any matter, always presents itself as a destruction of the given conditions. Moreover, there can be destruction without benefit to higher creativity. The right of destruction is thus a sign of superiority. By denying the peoples of the great migration the justification for their destruction, one remains attached to the old hierarchical structure of the Roman Empire, a system already in the throes of collapse.


**DESTRUCTION - CONSUMPTION**

Seen from the outside, each consumption looks like destruction.
In the contemporary economy, the instability of the production-consumption balance is only apparent. This is a false notion that masks both the importance and the volume of production and consumption.

In reality, the considerable increase in the means of the former on the one hand, and in the needs of the latter on the other, tends to create an absolute correspondence and equivalence between the two.

We are moving towards the perfect.

Among the data on the basis of which production "thinks its products" is the conviction that consumption is essentially destructive in nature. No creation of objects is undertaken without the addition of elements that will precipitate their consumption. As destructive factors, they accelerate their disappearance.

From now on, the life of the manufactured product is voluntarily shortened from the outset. It is no longer durable but ephemeral. Its consumption is no longer deferred but immediate. Solid and stable products have ceased to be desired and the Americans have even created an expression which designates these products guaranteed without duration.

In view of this situation, it seems to us that vandalism is simply consumption like any other.

At the same time, some economists consider war and war economy as a gigantic consumption. Essayists and philosophers assure us that production necessarily gives rise, in the more or less long term, to a war economy.


**SITUGRAPHIC APPLICATION IN EUROPE**

Only triolectic analysis can dispel the confusion created by effects that have been ignored until now. Hence the importance of the means of detecting fundamental complementarities. How can they be detected? We will take as irrefutable proof of the existence of the complementarity of two cultures the fact that in one of them Reaction uses - with the intention of slowing down progress - the progressive ideas of the other. We in Europe today are witnesses to such a situation. We need only look north, south and east.

Geographically, the geometric layout of the capitals of the Latin countries reflects a median, symmetrical and central composition. All roads lead to Rome. Or to Paris. Or to Brasilia.

Stockholm, Oslo, Copenhagen, London, New York: all border cities that are truly turned towards the unknown and open to foreign countries.

Like pre-war Vienna, Berlin bore the traces of the character of the old Roman-Christian Empire invented by Charlemagne. It was a constant feature of post-war American policy to exploit Berlin's character as a border city. The agreement with Russia will obviously shift this game to Jerusalem - the border city of the "Christian nation". The conflict between Abelard and Bernard is once again topical, but this time the answers are known in advance. The fascination is no longer there except for the fools.

At the basis of every system, or social organization, there are always three complementary elements: production, administration and consumption. The Latin, Germanic and Russo-Byzantine systems differ in the way in which they apply these elements: the Latin system seems to us to be characterized firstly by the virtualization of administration and secondly by the actualization of the variable unit production-consumption; Germanic by the virtualization of consumption on the one hand, and on the other by the actualization of a fusion between production and administration. Finally, the Russo-Byzantine system based on the virtualization of production and the updated merger between administration and consumption.

We have previously noted the existence of a parallelism that appears consumption to be a destruction. In the Germans - and in them alone - the desire for purity permeates and animates the act of consuming to such an extent that it makes their system of consumption a unique system. On the other hand, the Latin principles of consumption allow, authorize and promote a freedom of play, and this without further restricting this same freedom of play in production. But in the Latin framework, the freedom of consumption - or destruction - never becomes total and always remains below the Nordic "barbaric point".

These different systems, which are responsible for different "situational settings," have led the situationist movement to recognize and admit the diversity of these methods. It is because this movement has been willing to critically examine the different natures of these methods that it has been able to maintain its homogeneity. In the first post-war years, opposition to the classical concept of art manifested itself in two ways: some were in favor of the creation of a new kind of art that would represent an opposite dimension to classical art; others decided even more radically to deny the value of art in any field with an anti-artistic attitude. In Latin culture, the opposition to art and its marginalization has certainly never been total - this opposition being above all rhetorical. But it must be emphasized that this opposition based on rhetoric, and which therefore excludes any personally experienced attitude and sincerity, is of a terribly more radical nature than all other oppositions. In Paris, for example, the modern trend has brought about a situation that tends towards complete emptiness - this in the avowed aim of taking away all possible freedom and fulfilment from art, and in the secret project of transforming it into a means, into an instrument. This movement, which is deeply representative of the Nordic existential attitude on the artistic level, would gain in originality and authority if the thoughts of the various minds which, in their various capacities - philosophers, poets or thinkers - were better known, and if the public knew better how these various thoughts are articulated. Thus, behind Kierkegaard there is a Poul Martin Möller, a little like the genius of Socrates behind Plato's system. Let us say in passing that there is no reason to believe that Socrates - originally a sculptor - would have consented to this exclusion of the free arts later professed by Plato. Sartre made the gross error of considering Kierkegaard's scholastic system as humanism. Shortly before his death, Poul Martin Môller wrote a poem entitled "L'artiste entre les révoltés". This poem tells how, in 1830, in Paris, a group of rebels broke into an artist's studio in order to destroy his work and how the attacked artist reacted vigorously with a violent counter-attack. I must have been deeply impressed by this poem, which had its author classified as "politically reactionary". A poem remarkable for its great beauty, it is also remarkable for its political character: half a century after the imaginary confrontation that is its subject, a similar conflict, but real this time, breaks out within the Paris Commune. Prophetically again, this poem seems to have brought to light contradictions which today have become the internal contradictions of the SI, because Debord and all its supporters questioned the unity of this movement. The anecdote of the arsonists who came to destroy Notre-Dame in the last days of the Commune and clashed with a battalion of armed artists "constitutes a good example of direct democracy" and allows us to understand the ambivalence of any a priori conservative protection: against these men who wanted to gain access to expression by translating their total challenge to a society of oppressors into a destructive demonstration, was the unanimous group of artists right to defend Notre-Dame in the name of permanent aesthetic values? And finally, in the name of the spirit of the Museums?

Politically partisans of the Commune, "these artists acting as specialists found themselves in conflict with an extremist manifestation of the fight against alienation. "(Debord,). In the dustbin of history.

What happens when one of the protagonists disappears at the end of a fight? And especially when one of the three elements is annihilated when he is alone against a group of two others? A schism immediately arises between the two parties whose union against the common adversary previously formed an actualized antagonism. Depolarization polarizes the former allies. A struggle begins for the possession of the goods now available to the disappeared. The appropriation of these goods will trigger a process of identification with the former adversary in the future possessor, a new union that represents a possibility of actualization. Every war and every state of combat aims at annihilating an adversary who is less real than virtualized, so that the disappearance of the latter somehow actualizes his reality, to the point that at the end of a combat one sometimes has the paradoxical impression that the loser is the winner. It is obviously clear that without the will of each of the two surviving protagonists to become the owner of the property of the disappeared, no fight would take place between them.

It is certain that Debord reveals his mentality and his political-Latin training by considering artists as pure specialists and, finally, as mere instrumental means.* History shows that artists have constantly fought against the apriorism of this identification; their participation in all the great revolutionary currents is proof of this, and this utilitarian attitude towards art has always been considered by them as a form of oppression and an attack on their freedom. This oppression was adopted, officialized and legalized in 787 by the Council of Nicaea.

In approving the action of the arsonists against the armed artists (1), Debord slipped into the trap door that Estivals had prepared. For years, he has been saying that the affinity between Debord and me is "pure practical trickery with no basis in common ideas. Unfortunately, Debord's acquiescence in incendiary vandalism, in this case where socialism and barbarism are at odds, is on the side of the barbarians. For - let us ask ourselves - by what means did these artists intend to destroy the arsonists? Quite simply by resorting to teutonic acts...

Wanting to judge, in a society where the military reality is all-powerful, or at least the barbarity of conduct and behaviour, is a vain and doomed project. The acceptance of vandalism leads, ipso facto, to consent to Teutonism. That Debord - committed as he is now - can return to the conventional and agreed positions which are, in fact, those of the Parisian avant-garde, seems to us neither desirable nor possible.

The concept of situation - this all-purpose concept of existentialist thought, this false sesame of an outdated and bastard philosophy - did not take J.-P. Sartre very far. The vitality of situationism makes this Franco-German existentialism, which is comfortably based on a set of old propositions - precisely on the Danish existentialism of the last century - seem moribund. This French sucker for existentialism, therefore, has not imprisoned Debord. However, one becomes the amused witnesses of this paradoxical spectacle: on the one hand Sartre, who was initially concerned with writing for future generations, was gradually pushed back to the contemporary and drowned in an overabundant actuality; on the other hand Debord, interested only in actuality, finds himself condemned to build a distant future, and this in view of a posthumous glory which, in fact, indifferent to him...

The Latin spirit and character are easily accommodated - naturally - to the existentialist "living the present". The pure instant is for them an obvious banality, an immediate reality, whereas for Nordic thought and temperament - let us say for Kierkegaard - the pure instant is a crazy dream and a vain hope.

The fear that Cobra's activity might lead to a one-sided Nordicism made me seek the collaboration of a man whom I thought could be the ideal successor to André Breton as a fertile promoter of new ideas. I appointed Debord, and nothing since then has changed my mind about him.


**STATE - FAMILY - NATION**

In his study on the origin of the family, Friedrich Engels deepens Marxist thought on the factors of human progress. This "progress" seems to him to pass through three phases: the wild stage - which is that of pure consumption and corresponds to the non-productivity of the hunters; the barbarian stage - characterized by production oriented towards consumption; the civilized stage - which produces in order to produce, without any consumption, is linked to the appearance of slavery. The slave was a producer who was denied any right to consumption. In underhanded and underhand forms, Western society has created a subjugation and enslavement that is not unrelated to former slavery.

All the false judgements, errors and chimerical ideas concerning the notion of progress are mercilessly brought to light by the triolectic system. It is impossible to create a valid opposition to barbarism without seeing savagery and slavery as one and the same thing - which is, at the end of the day, civilization. Civilization is the savagery that is justified by the moral obligation to maintain slavery. Material consequence and social reality: production that does not give rise to consumption. Isolating the producer, freeing the slave: this is what it really means to face up to barbarism, to savagery. This is the programme and the aims of Socialism - a tendency that manifests the intention to "make peace" with the Savage, in order to recover for him the force that animates him in the form of destructive power. Socialism thus returns, without glory, to the old opposition between civilization and barbarism. It tries to bring production and administration closer together and refuses to see that this alliance is nothing more than a new antagonism. It is an inexorable process that makes hell for everyone, and from which the Situationist International alone is free.

We now know that every revolution - as an expression of the will for social progress - generates a superior social life, but introduces into that same life a greater uniformity, in the guise of stability, and ruthlessly restricts the freedom of each person. The situationist tendency must aim at regaining the right to human free play, a play which F. Entfremdung is constantly reducing.

The graffiti - be they Norman, Parisian or other - are evidence of this desire to be present, and of an opposition to the sacrosanct technique. A tendency such as the situationist movement risks appearing counter-revolutionary. In reality, such a tendency makes it possible to clearly see the error committed by the engineer Sorel, who studied the revolutionary movements of our century according to his clean slate system. At the beginning of the last century, Poul Martin Möller had already sensed the possibility of error in the following apophtegmus: a revolutionary movement is only of value at the stage preceding its practical realization. Formulation that can be carried out otherwise, and give rise to images that borrow from a mechanistic reality. Thus, it can be understood that it is exclusively during a fall that energies are released, both new and available; that after the fall follows a new stage in which the energies become more blocked than before. Thus even the trio-lectic system is both a springboard and a brake: it releases energies and then blocks them. Poul Martin Möller has already explained this: "A new idea is only of value when it penetrates the mass. Once it is generally accepted, it is devalued. "It is therefore obvious that the day when the symbolic oppositions that geographically divide Europe into North and South disappear, the exceptional sources of admirable energy will also disappear.

It is not only a duty, it is a right to demand that this energy should not be wasted in vain fighting, but that it should instead be used for general enrichment.

Of all the stories of the Germans, that of Friedrich Engels seems to me to be the most intelligent and impartial.

He gives an excellent answer to the question: "What was the mysterious spell with which the Germans breathed new life into the dying Europe", but he does not fully explain why the mere appearance of barbarity in a civilization was enough to create new sociological foundations - superior and forever irreducible.

Engels tells us that: "The Germans were barbarians, in that they did not succeed in establishing total slavery as the labour slavery of antiquity and the domestic slavery of the East did. "In the depths of the psyche there is no difference between rights and duties. The concept of property, the "fruit of personal labour", which is the subject of this paper, is therefore no longer valid.

Engels continues: "Civilization creates a class that is no longer concerned with production (or consumption), but only with the exchange of goods: the merchants. "Engels does not seem to realize that once liberated from the merchant class in which it originated, this activity forged the structures of the state. Engels is therefore light-hearted in stating: "The Gentile organization ceased to exist and was replaced by the state" and "the state inevitably falls with the division of society into classes, relegated to the Museum of Antiquities, next to the bronze spinning wheel and axe". It is to be expected that the spinning wheel and the axe will in this case always remain indispensable instruments.

"Marital union is the cell-form of civilized society. It marks a great historical progress; however, with it begins an era in which every progress is also - at the same time - a relative step backwards. "Engels tells of a time when physicists discovered the law of constant energy. A law which is without weight in the socialist world, because in the eyes of Marxists - and of Lassalle - "The united force is greater than the sum of the combined forces. "We are in the miraculous...

Engels wondered how it could have happened that the Roman family, with a more primitive organization than that of the people (people-family), could have marked a progress in relation to it. And also the barbaric people of the Germans compared to the Roman family. It seems that the deep reasons for this evolutionary dynamism escaped Engels.

The barbarian people were not in any way erased. It was even so little erased that its original vigour gradually became, over the centuries, a real power; so that nowadays it is the only one that is opposed to the concept of the state. It is no longer called the people but the nation.

The identification of the past with the present, of origin with reality, of birth with contemporaneity, gives life to the reputedly noble concept of nation. If, however, in view of the important Germanic contribution to the building of medieval Europe, it is rightly denied any role in modern culture, we will be at risk of understanding nothing at all about the future of Europe. The future of Europe will remain dark.

It was through the Arianist church that the Europe of the people became the Europe of the nations. The important role played by this church in the development of Europe would be even more essential if we were to have all the information that a long period of deliberate obscurantism has taken away from us. The transformation of people into nations was greatly facilitated - if not entirely achieved - by the theologians who introduced into the baptism ceremony a ritual whose high power of meaning was a salutary shock to consciences. The Christian baptism ceremony symbolically determined a new epoch: the dawn of a rebirth.

The importance of this ceremony in Scandinavia is understandable, even before the advent of Christianity, and it is also understandable why the Scandinavians still show a manic interest in medieval baptismal fonts today. It would not be easy to explain the participation of the Nordic people in the crusades if they were denied any sense of religious belonging to the Christian nation.

France was the only European country not to be fooled by the national character of Christian expansion. In "The Birth of the Middle Ages," L.B. Moss explains why: "In Gaul, Clovis set the seal on his work by organizing a national church that brought together the political advantages of Arianism and Catholicism. "The symmetry of the roles played by the State and the Nation was later to lead the French to become standard bearers of the idea of nationalism and then - without stumbling unduly on chauvinism - to enrich the world with a concept whose effects have not yet been fully felt: the concept of internationalism.

Thus the Christian nationalism of the Germanic peoples, defenseless against the Catholic "church-state", found itself under the theocratic pressure of that formidable "church-state", incapable of assuming the secular responsibilities of a theocracy. This theocratic pressure threw the last Nordic hopes into the fire, which disappeared in the smoke of the pyres where the Templars died. The pitiful glory returned to France, but the nation-state was created. In this new state, place was given to the family and to its chief majordomus, whom we would unfortunately come to know as the chancellor.

The woman in the North who took care of the house and was in charge of it, would see her importance grow enormously through this expansion of the family. We know the effects of this from the history of the Middle Ages: playing the church against the men, she herself later became a prisoner of the church. Things happened differently in Byzantium and the state prevailed. The Soviet republics are national and united in an all-powerful state. It is at least Stalin's Russia, the Russia of his book on nationalities.

It is more than interesting - it is impressive - to compare with the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics the genesis of a nation such as the United States, where the national idea takes an expansive, supra-state form.

It is necessary to get an idea of the nature of the complementarity existing between French internationalism, American nationalism and Russian statism, if one does not want to become the victim of chimeras and illusions as to the possibilities of general agreement.


**TING - POLIS - SOVIET**

The modern state has differentiated powers in three forms: legislative, legal and executive. It is through the union of two of these powers - the principle of antagonism tells us so - that the modern state acquires vitality and dynamism.

In the Latin world, the virtualisation is that of the judgment, while in the Nordic world it is that of the execution. I think it is necessary to insist on this: in the former, the fusion is between legislation and judgment, while in the latter, it is between legislation and enforcement. As it is understood that legislative activity is political, the dynamism of the Polis is here concretized. In the Nordic Ting, enforcement is unconditional and it is the judgment that takes on a political character. We can see, therefore, that the principle of the Ting, far from being, as is often claimed (especially in Germany), a "rudimentary Polis", has its own dynamism, which is complementary to that of the Polis.

Better legal bases of political power have brought to the application of the Ting principle in the U.S.A. a purity that it does not have in Scandinavia. The execution of President Kennedy's presumed murderer reveals covert political manoeuvres which are an attack on the very system of government which the United States adopted after the end of the civil war. Will the seriousness of this act ever be sanctioned?

The reluctance of those who are descendants of the former Northerners to take legal action on this matter proves the existence of a passionate complex of tendencies. This situation seems to us to bear a strange and significant similarity to one of the episodes in the struggle of the Germans against the Romans - the one reported by Engels -: the manoeuvre of Arminius to defeat Varus and thus put a definitive end to the Roman plans for the colonization of the Germanic countries. When the Romans found themselves confronted with acts, principles and methods that were radically foreign to them, they realised that they were powerless and abandoned their enterprise. In both cases, through violence and brutality, it was the same defeat of civilized values.

During the war there was a man in Holland who was so disgusted by the intensity of Danish and Norwegian curiosity about the invaders that he preferred to commit suicide. Had this man of honour known the story of Arminius, he might have been less shocked that nobody turned his back on the invaders and probably sensed that this attitude would make the Scandinavian resistance the most effective of the European organisations.

Arminius remained at Varus' side as if he had been his friend, while at the same time he organized and set up the enormous enterprise which was to crush the Roman army. He might even have been able to drive the Romans out of Gaul, but he was no conqueror. It was William the Bastard who revealed this possibility.

The Romans' tenacious and irreducible mistrust of the Germanic people dates from this time.

It seems, in these circumstances, that the Germanic people stuck to the precept: "One should only be honest with honest people", the Ting rule. As to how the Romans judged this event, Engels tells us that "one believes to read French writers of the best chauvinist period, who empty the cup of their anger on the perjury of York and the betrayal of the Saxons in Leipzig. The Germans had learned enough about treaty fidelity and Roman loyalty when Caesar attacked the Usipetes and Tencterians by surprise during the negotiations and in the midst of the armistice; they had learned what they were when Augustus imprisoned the legates of the Sicambres, before whose arrival he refused to negotiate with the Germanic tribes. All conquering peoples have in common that they deceive their adversary in every possible way and find it quite regular; but as soon as the adversaries allow themselves the same thing, they cry out for perjury and treason. But as soon as opponents allow themselves to do the same, they cry out for perjury and treason. Now the means used to reduce to subjection must be just as lawful to throw off the yoke. »

Engels' last consideration is undoubtedly correct. We must, however, note that the Germanic peoples have endeavoured to refine and make remarkably effective two techniques peculiar to them: those of disorganization of action and that of organization of protest action. In the latter they have acquired such a degree of efficiency that they have been called - not without reason - the Protestants.

It is necessary to know how important the Ting principle has become in American life and how much it permeates the spirit of the laws of this country. An obligation such as that placed upon every citizen appearing before judges to tell "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth" is significant in this regard. We see the honest man of the Ting. On the contrary, he who refuses information and conceals it is dishonoured and excluded. Whether or not the information is of an intimate nature does not dispense with the obligation of absolute sincerity.

This practice is difficult to reconcile with the ideal of the Polis. On the contrary, the rhetoric of this ideal requires "telling everything but the truth", as illustrated by the story of the young Spartan who, with his intestines torn open by a fox, would rather die than admit to being the author of a theft. Both methods have their advantages. But the American desire to use them together leads to disastrous dead ends.

In Northern Europe, acknowledgement of the facts was always made through vague and imprecise confessions. If the facts were very detailed, the narrative became ambiguous, obscure and nebulous to the point where no one understood it at all. This was the beginning of an anti-rhetoric that later permeated a certain literature. Exasperating literature for a purist with an eminently critical mind like Anatole France, who saw in it a challenge to the famous clarity that the French so much value.

The Germanic spirit seemed to be inclined to concealment, hypocrisy and lies. Strabo describes the Germans as "roués, a people made to lie", and the Roman Velleius speaks of the Celts as follows: "Simple and without wickedness, they rush into battle before the eyes of all and without caution, so that their opponents have easy victory. »

But a critical sense, a taste for precision and a concern for accuracy often lead the French to a need for truth and a drunkenness that, in the end, is called cynicism. Frankness - etymologically "les Francs" - also presents odious certainties.

France is nevertheless the worthy successor of this ardent Gaul. It has for her a taste for political justice which makes her the best guarantor in the world of equality and truth.

Of the various contributions of the provinces to French vitality, the Norman factor was not the least important.

And in terms of art, Norman graffiti did not contribute little to illuminating the meaning of the image, the sign and the writing.

The appearance of the Soviets, or popular councils, was not foreseen in the Russian revolution, and yet it was the driving force behind it. Lenin did not see the old tradition of Slavic culture resurfacing here. He believed them to be a creative miracle of the people. Polis, Ting and Soviet, here are three complementary, irreducible and fundamental structures in European development. Like Aron, the psychologist C. G. Jung uses the spiritual structuring of the Polis to explain unconsciousness; Adler chose the Ting, and Freud the Soviet, without these structures being "political". The illusion of a synthesis here on the classical basis, even if modernized, is excluded. A new method is needed. Can the triolectic be this method? We shall see.
