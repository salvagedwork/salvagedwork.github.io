It is interesting to compare Botticelli's diabolical triple head to Titian's allegory of Prudence: an old man (himself), his son and his nephew; that is, the Past of Age, the Present of Maturity and the Future of Youth - a text which suggests that the Present can both benefit from past experiences and not compromise future actions. In this image of Titian, Erwin Panofsky sees a prayer made by Titian to his son to give his nephew every chance to flourish. Panofsky reports Giordano Bruno's penetrating analysis of the three faces of Time. All the analyses of this image of Titian - very simple in appearance - reveal conflicts of interpretation, passionate conflicts from which, paradoxically, Prudence is banished. The totality of Western languages reveal, in syntax, a Time divided into Past, Present and Future, forms to which every mind must necessarily become accustomed and which, in practice, have become commonplace for everyone. The language that breaks Time down for us, on a formal level, into three different aspects, into three images of different moments, this language is for the mind a mould whose considerable importance has escaped us until the last few years. Prisoners of language - it has long been impossible for us to escape the Time that syntax represents for us. This syntax breaks down into an apparently harmonious triplicity of pure Duration; that is to say, it demands of us an important mental operation: that which consists in intuitively grasping that only one of the aspects - only one of the forms of Time is always opposable to the other two assemblies. The concept of triplicity, in which three elements play the same role, conceals and obscures the principle of antagonism: any one element is always opposable to all the other two. Stéphane Lupasco has studied the structure of a particular antagonism - that of the static and the dynamic: "In order for any event to take place, at any moment and in any place in the Universe, an energy, a dynamism must be able to pass from a certain state of potentialization to a certain state of actualization, otherwise, rigorously actualized or actualized, one could not even speak of energy, of dynamism, everything would be static, stagnant, since always and forever. »

The triple polarization of Time, as it appears in language, is indeed the image of that eternal static of which Lupasco speaks: "Thus any energy - any energetic movement - in any form - implies an antagonistic event and such that the actualization of one leads to the potentialization (virtualization) of the other. "It is the union of any two of the aspects in which Time appears to us that has the power to actualize it and, on the other hand, to virtualize or potentiate its third aspect. It follows, therefore, that the notion of Time conceals three different kinds of antagonisms, which differ according to the nature of the one aspect of Time that one chooses to oppose to the other two. We will have the meeting of the past-present opposing its virtualized opposite: the future; then the past-future opposing the present; and finally the present-future opposing the past.

Lupasco states: "An antagonistic pair of energetic events and anti-energetic events constitutes - and only he can constitute - a system, that is, that set of events linked and controlled by intrinsic dynamic forces or relationships, inherent4 in the events themselves. This is what I have formalized in a Logic of Systems or Systemology. Many are certainly the possible combinations of these systems of systems, many their chains in tree expansion or systemogenesis; however, there are always three of them. »

When I examined the structure of Latin culture, it seemed to me - even before I became acquainted with Lupasco's theories (which did not address the problem of Time and its triple aspect) - that this system of Latin structures involved an actualisation of the past-future, and a virtualisation of the present; that on the contrary the Byzantine and Russian structures had a present-future opposable to the past, and finally that the Nordic structures were essentially a past-present actualisation and a virtualisation of the future.

On the theological level, the symbolism of the Trinity offers us a good opportunity to understand the opposition of the Aryanism of the Germanic peoples to the Romanicity of the Latins: between Father and Son, a distinction of essences to which the latter are absolutely opposed. An opposition which, freed from all theological terminology, is reappearing today in Europe on the scientific, philosophical and artistic levels. The famous scientist and theorist Werner Heisenberg highlights in "Physics and Philosophy" the fact that "in classical theory we assume that the future and the past are separated by an infinitely short interval of time that we can call the present. In relativity theory, we have learned that this is not the case: the future and the past are separated by a time interval that exists and whose duration depends on the distance between the observed phenomenon and the observer. "One cannot better emphasize the fact that in classical theory the present is dimensionless, i.e. without a face, and therefore time is reduced to only two dimensions: a Janus head. The relativity that gives the present a dimension makes it an elective place of possible encounter between these two poles that the past and the future represent for us. A time of dialogue is thus instituted: that of the necessary delay between question and answer.

Locke, who defines knowledge as "the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas", leaves us in the embarrassment of deciding by which antagonism the knowledge of the idea of the relativistic present is made: is it by the idea of the past or by the idea of the future? Certainly neither of these two ideas can play a role by themselves, while their union in a single concept of past-future has the force of opposition - antagonism - with respect to the present: "the properties of symmetry are always the most essential characteristics of a theory". Between the real - the ultimate form of the present - and the possible - the union of the past and the future - there are relations that have long remained mysterious.

However, this merging into a single concept of past and future, as well as the notion of antagonism, has just been vigorously criticized by a young Russian scientist, Mr. N.A. Kozyrev, who stated that "there is no symmetry between action and reaction, that time can only pass in one direction: from past to future; and that the future is in essence completely different from the past.”
