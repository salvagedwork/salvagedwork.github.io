*Some examples of triolectic complementarity*

We present here some triolectic equilibrium models applied to different conceptual domains. It should be stressed that these are simple working bases, not dogmatic, which can be modified and extended. It is in their nature to be open, starting, for example, on a number greater than three relations, this method being obviously not linked to any number mysticism. Its purpose is to liberate the fixed dialectical movements either in the submixist determinism or in the non-chosen antagonisms where Lupasco got stuck.

The future being the goal, and the present the instrument or means, the past represents the result.

The triple possibility of fusion imposed by the establishment of the three antagonisms is thus presented:

Teleology. The goal justifies the means (present-future fusion);

Experimentalism. It is neither before nor during the act that a justification can take place, but only when the result is there.
The result justifies the means used (fusion) past-present).

Moralism. The goal merges with the result and justification is opposed to both; justification justifies itself because it is an instrumental means (past-future fusion).

One must be able to choose between these three dialectics. They cannot be confused. Each has its own logic.

Concepts formed from three elements in a static order risk remaining shrouded in mystery and not being clear enough for the mind; they require a deeper study of the very conditions of their formation.

Two out of three of the given elements always correspond to this formation, and the opposing concepts are in opposition to each other. In order to be well understood, and to be well executed, this mental operation requires us to be fully aware that all our concepts are affected by a dynamism proper to life.

This is why a sketch (even rudimentary) of the most elementary data of this formation of concepts appeared necessary to us. We have undertaken this work here, but we must express our reservations about the conclusions. We have therefore grouped together in groups of three the words that seem to us to be the basic elements of this formation of triple concepts. The list below does not claim to be exhaustive; however, with the help of this classification into a system, it may become possible to

for each of us to become aware of the antagonisms in which we electively and symbolically inscribe our conduct. Obviously, we are so accustomed to hearing and understanding these words in a number of meanings other than those of the dynamism of life alone, that it will certainly be disconcerting to find them here in their ideal static purity. We have classified them into three groups which correspond preferentially to the Latin forms of Germanic and Byzantine structuring activities.

A Swedish scholar has shown that in optics the phenomenon of the transformation of triple contrasting colours is related to the Gila fabric and that their juxtaposition is done in this fabric. The study of the phenomenon is difficult because of the lack of sufficient psycho-physiological information. Greater knowledge will allow a better approach to mental illness. Lupasco's theory has the great merit of having highlighted the identity existing between the physical concept of potentiality and the ethical concept of virtuality.

The sacred and the taboo are concept words in which the ambivalence of ethics and theology on the one hand, and the power of the fulfilling Mana on the other, are particularly strong.

Between the sacred (virtualized) and the divine (actualized) we have established the existence of a certain antagonism - antagonism which restores the word Divine to its original content: play - variation.

The history of the whole of Christianity is, after all, that of its division into complementary antagonisms, that of the successive schisms of the Church. These have finally revealed three distinct areas: the Greek-Byzantine church: game present-future; the Roman-Catholic church: past-future; Nordic Protestantism: past-present. Here we have three complementary concepts of the sacred: first, the concept of the past, which I will call "production", because in industrial society production and reproduction are equivalent; second, the concept of the present, which is "administration"; and third, "consumption", which corresponds to the sacred future of Protestants. Whatever it costs us and whatever discomfort it causes us, we must bear in mind these types of concepts, which are so dreadfully contradictory, since they are born of radically different mental processes. We must not give in to the dangerous ease of believing it possible - with Raymond Aron - to harmonize a system of hierarchy of values (such as his) with Max Weber's world of free play. Let us refuse what would be a fallacious illusion. And let's not hide the fact that there is an obligation of choice here for those who wish to avoid that, one day, a cohesion built on misunderstandings and false agreements will be shattered. A spectacle that I fervently hope I will not witness with sadness...

To take the full dimension of the drama that is currently playing out in people's consciences, one only has to hear Stéphane Lupasco say without hesitation: "All psychiatry must be revised". A statement in relation to which we immediately - optimistically - inscribe our triolectic system, eminently capable, in our opinion, of bringing some clarification on the functioning of the deep psyche, and of giving a rational account of the nature of the great mental illnesses that have been incurable up to now.

It is not our opinion (in contrast to Lupasco, who seems to cultivate schizophrenia) that development should take place from the concrete to the abstract. Currently turned almost exclusively towards popular art, the plastic arts manifest at least by this very impulse a health that it would be vain to deny them.

Among the antagonisms that Lupasco is concerned about, there is one in which his thought is particularly captive, it seems to us: that of space and time. "The simultaneity of certain cerebral events engenders the notion of space," Lupasco assures us. We have known for a long time - let's say since Heisenberg - that the notions of space and time are not alien to each other but, on the contrary, that they are identical, the present also being simultaneous. Between question and answer there is a time limit, a duration which is the present itself, the real being space. That the time between question and answer is longer and the present will grow all the more - at the expense of the past and the future. At the limit, we would find an absolute, integral, eternal present: "Waiting for Godot".

The false and illusory possibility of introducing some balance into the antagonism of time and space has been denounced, with subtle effectiveness, by Kozyref, who has shown us the differences in essence between the components (the past, the future) of the notion of time.

The sense of the sacred evolves and the notion of the divine also undergoes metamorphoses. The diversity of these transformations could make us believe in a progress in Art, so much our emotional or mental dispositions are sometimes changed. Suddenly we no longer recognize ourselves in this or that spiritual kinship, in this or that intellectual family. Yes, we are unstable: in turn we are also turned towards the old arts or towards the new ones. Nevertheless, it is the complex human being who seeks his way to life in this way - in ourselves.

If I had succeeded in showing, by the example of one of these transformations, the immutability of its mechanism (as immutable as the range of colours), my attempt would not have been entirely in vain.

The transformation of the material conditions of man's life is easily and commonly related to progress - to industrial progress. Perhaps there is a carefree lightness here that future generations - if not ourselves - may pay a high price for. For this "progress" is strangely, frighteningly pervasive. If we wish to prevent its monstrously inhuman efficiency from increasing without limit, if we wish to prevent its power from spreading to infinity and if we wish to prevent man from becoming the frightened victim of an insane holocaust, we must remain masters of the thousand material circumstances that make up the fabric of our daily lives. Keep them at our service. Not to pass to theirs. It is an imperative alternative where the life of each person sometimes gets bogged down and sometimes blossoms, and from which only - let us say it - the artist with a creative spirit can truly free himself.

Indeed, after Blake and Turner, who saw in dreams the pledge and guarantee of all truly fulfilled human existence and courageously charged it with the weight of their own lives, truly creative artists have embarked on this path where invention is queen and truth is the mandate. It is not in the power of any religious or ideological, spiritual or material power to subject the vitality of creative spirits to its law. For such spirits testify above all to their freedom. Their strength is not of an instrumental nature. Their strength is not of an instrumental nature; it would become instrumental if they ceased to exist as spirits.


**The Triolectic Principle of Complementarity**

Lupasco says:

"As such -- as dynamics -- antithetical elements possess the constitutive property of the very notion of dynamism... The logic of the contradictory is a tridialectic, it generates three dialectics that are ordered. »

The disjunction: it is the very cog in the wheel of dialectic: No dialectic without disjunction, and no disjunction without dialectic.

OUR TRIOLECTIC PRESENTS ITSELF AXIOMATICALLY IN THE FOLLOWING WAY:

We have previously demonstrated how and why these three dialectics are inevitable. By comparing the tridialectic dynamism with its correspondent of complementary static and triolect ique, we have shown the subtle mechanisms that govern them.

Each disjunction is followed by a conjunction and, likewise, each conjunction is followed by a disjunction.

The merger creates a fission (actualisation is the name given by Lupasco to this conjunction or merger).

Each compromise isolates and virtualizes the opposite attitude.

We have chosen to call the formation of an antagonism or a contradiction a mise en situation.

The basic elements necessary for the birth of any situation can be ordered in such a way as to form two situations that are also different and complementary to the first one.
