Micturition and whetstone are found in the Norse myths of Thor and Hrungnir.

The Skâldskaparmâl stories mentioned by Georges Dumézil give us the details. It is about the battle of Thor and Hrungnir. The latter has a heart, head and shield made of stone, and also has - as an offensive weapon - a whetstone (note that his heart is of a shape that later became that of the sign of Odin). Flanked by a clay dummy supposed to represent him, he goes to the place of rendezvous fixed for the battle and waits there for Thor.

When Thor arrives, the clay man is so frightened, it is said, "that he pisses when he sees Thor". Thor smashes the whetstone of Hrungnir with his hammer (a splinter will come to settle in his head) and then smashes his skull; but dragged into the fall of Hrungnir, he also falls and finds his neck caught under one of his feet. In order to free Thor thus held prisoner, it will be necessary to call upon his son - a toddler three nights old - who will succeed without difficulty. Thor will give the horse of Hrungnir to his son as a reward and, for doing so, will receive a reprimand from Odin.

Georges Dumézil thinks it possible that the tricorn character - a singular precision - of Hrungnir's heart is to be classified among the various triplicities of the adversaries opposed to the warrior hero, or to the God. These triplicities are typical, he adds, of many Indo-European legends: the three-headed adversary of the Indian Indra; of the Iranian Ferridûn; the three Curiaces defeated by the young Horace; Geyron, Heracles' adversary; the three Meic Nechtain, Cûchulainn's adversaries; Meche with a triple heart killed by Mac Cecht.

For us, the symbolism of the three is that of an acting, sacred and dangerous number. It seems to us to signify past, present and future time. A little like the nine that appears in the very old Germanic songs as meaning life and movement, but, in addition, the seal of fatality.

We have already said that the whetstone seems to us to be - by extension from the meaning of the knife - a symbol of male sexuality. The presence of the foot in graffiti still confirms us in this opinion.

The main accusation against the Templars was, according to John Charpentier, that in every province they had idols. These consisted of heads, some with three faces and others with human skulls.

John Charpentier did not think it unreasonable to think that the bapho-metrical images of the Temple looked like a kind of Janus. Cathedral builders were busy with the same baphomet. In Jutland, stones from the Viking period have been found representing triple heads - one of them with a third eye on the forehead, it is thought to be the representation of Mimir, who had received the eye of Odin (for wisdom). (See ill. 219.)

By all these various facts and clues, we are led to suppose that, in any case, it is this famous whetstone housed in the forehead of the god.

A study of the history of the Jomvikings and their relationship with the medieval knightly orders would fill a great gap. Also missing is a study on the worship of the whetstone.

The silence on these two points does not allow for the discovery of other than superficial relations between the Knights Templar and Norman graffiti.

This mystery, a factor that disturbs judgment, must be lifted and, in this particular case, we must denounce the contempt that official positions traditionally show for anything that goes beyond the general framework of an era.

We do not have the impression that the narrative of this struggle - of this confrontation - is being told by a neutral and impersonal witness, but rather that the reciter himself has been involved in the adventure that is being narrated to us. Who is he or she? In our opinion: an opponent of Odin, therefore Thor. The hypothesis that Thor is the narrator fits quite well with the accounts of the time when peace reigned between Thor and Odin. It also explains Odin's blame as corresponding to the traces in his memory of their long previous hostility. Let us return to the ideas we hold dear: in any conflict there are always three elements, and only one of them plays - psychologically speaking - the role of a victim. I am thinking here of the beheaded by the stone splinter in the forehead. Let us call him Mimir, the wisdom that possessed the eye of Odin. What could he have told us?

Let's try and identify his story with that of Baldr, killed by the blind Hoder who Loke assisted. Let us note in passing that this myth has strange connections with the myth of Palna-Toke - founder of the Jomsvikings organization - and William Tell, both of them shooting with a bow and arrow at an apple placed on their son's head. Hoder's use of mistletoe as an arrow reveals some possible links with the Celtic world. However, there are many other indications that this cult is pre-Celtic, linked to the Ibero-Ligurian Neolithic culture. In this one, we find the name of Baldr in the form of Bellin. Curiously, a phallic statue bearing this name was discovered in the south of France by an archaeologist named Bellin. The account of this one is very amusing, because Mr. Bellin is completely unaware of the popular use that is made, in Liguria, of this word with a phallic meaning.

It is of irresistible interest for an artist to discover the relationship between Bellin and the concept of belleza: beauty linked to bellicose aggressiveness - a strong reminder of the idea of Shiva. The origin of this word is not Latin. There are no traces of it in Germanic languages either, except for the word shön, whose Scandinavian equivalent kô'n means both sex and beauty.

That the Scandinavian language still has a third word to express beauty - the word smuk - does not seem to me to be due to chance. In India, the very ancient Harivamska calls the pre-Aryan deity Vayupurana "Smukha Trishira", that is to say "the three-headed beauty". It is also in India that the three-headed phallus is found as a Linga symbol - a sign of Shiva. Another of these three-headed statuettes was found in Dalmatia, in Zdrapanj, not far from a mountain called "Svante-vit" - which means "to see everything". Svante-vit" is the name of a statue found in Rügen, which was a Jomsviking centre. We know another one from Husiatyn, Poland. In terms of form, we see many similarities between the three-headed figure of the pre-Aryan culture of Middle Aryan-Daro - a figure sitting in a yoga position - and "the Celtic gods".

Although we do not lack the desire to do so, we will not dwell on elaborating an aesthetic based on the fundamental forms of this statuette, because the history of this image awaits us. And it reserves us surprises of a burning topicality.
