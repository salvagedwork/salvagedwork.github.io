I thought that the approach to the problem would not be easier for me with Kozyrev's theories on time-oriented time than with Lupasco's theories on antagonisms, all these theories not being sufficiently familiar to me and that, consequently, the best approach would be, for me, the theory of colours. So I tried to find a new solution in this area. The first obstacle encountered in this field was the evidence of a conflict between Niels Bohr's theory of complements and the Hegelian and Marxist dialectic.

The notion of the "complementarity" of colours had been perfectly defined long before Bohr began his studies. The word "complementary" was used to designate contrasting colours at opposite ends of any diameter of the spectral circle. Colours that, when mixed, neutralize each other and always produce a similar grey, regardless of the chosen diameter.

This polarization of so-called "complementary" colours, but which we prefer to call contrasting, seemed to obey marvellously to the principles of the Hegelian dialectic - thesis, anti-thesis, synthesis. Using Lupasco's terminology, we will name potential or virtual colours, blue, yellow and red, which are on the spectral circle three irreducible sectors. These colours oppose each other like the angles of a triangle, and not in a double polarized antagonism. Red is a mixture of yellow and blue - green; blue is a mixture of red and yellow - orange; yellow is a mixture of red and blue - purple. From these findings, I have established that any mixture is characterized as an actualized pole. Variability or play are the elements that (at least) the mixture reveals. From this definition, from this place given to play by any mixture, Lupasco was unable - or unwilling - to take into account in its system. He became prisoner of an antagonism limited to the opposition of the homogeneous and the heterogeneous. Antiquity already knew the triangular model of the three invariable constants. It appears as three superimposed triangles, forming a star, in the seal of Solomon known as the "seal of Good and Evil". Drawing the diagonals that link them together is, in terms of communication, to bring about a reconciliation between Kant and Hegel.

The simultaneity of Lupascot's awareness in Koryzev and myself seems to me to be historically significant, if we take into account the fact that they were carried out in an absolutely independent manner; Lupasco's concern was only a certain need for clarity in the logic-philosophical domain; Koryzev, the desire to respond to certain astro-scientific demands; and finally, myself, a purely artistic interest in the problem of colours - after Goethe and the painter Runge, the desire to understand them better.

Lupasco stresses that light and "death" are synonymous. In a Newtonian perspective, however, the different colours make up light: it follows that the world of colours extends beyond the limit of "death". On this particular point, Goethe rejects any interest in Newtonian theory by asserting that the division of light into colours is an inverse process - from materialisation to a tendency towards "life". It seemed to me that the ignorance and contempt in which the scholars held Goethe's impressive assertions necessitated and made possible the elaboration of a third theory of light, complementary to the other two.

The scheme that I thought I should propose here - the Triolectic - arose from this critical examination of the interpretation of Copenhagen, which I had entitled "the interpretation of Silkeborg". The situlogy, of which this schema is only a part, takes up the concept of situs analysis (Poincar√©) but avoids giving too much importance to the notion of positional limit as formulated in the topology. Indeed, with Gaston Bachelard, we judge that, in the concept of the situation, the event and the time must be involved.
