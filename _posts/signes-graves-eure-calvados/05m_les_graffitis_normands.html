How to decide the place of Norman graffiti in the chronology of European development? Analytical methods due to Latin training seem to us to be very helpful in this respect. However, the problem remains, since it is above all a question of accounting for and explaining the significant power of these graffiti. The difficulty remains in understanding how and why they appear to us to be highly significant of a reality that concerns us intimately.

To try to date these graffiti with great precision is, we believe, to disperse our forces, and above all to distract our attention from their high significance value. Which obviously escapes all temporality. Let's not doubt that an enhancement of these graffiti, which would really depend on their real importance, is critical - and in a convincing way - of the traditional structuring of the History of Art. Bringing these graffiti into the History of Art, perhaps adds to the already great confusion in which it is currently being debated. The risk is great but we must take it: it is the chance of renewal.

The value of a Culture and its possibilities for progress depend essentially on the capacity to absorb new data and to integrate these elements into a series of systematizing structures. These elements tend to eliminate the systematizing structure itself, both as an obstacle to its capacity to absorb and integrate, and as a limitation of that capacity. Hence the importance of spontaneous reactions and over-radicalized tendencies generated by these new elements. In this sense, the desire for "ultra-modernity" on the part of some reactionaries goes beyond the real possibilities of evolution. No less dangerous appears to us the utopian optimism of some progressives in whose eyes no frontiers exist. And it is often in good faith that many of them, engaged in a zone of antagonistic and contrary culture, bring with the support of their progressivism a moral guarantee to the adversary himself.

Editions E. Einaudi - progressive among all Italian publishing houses - has just published a remarkable work, already considered a classic, by Gabriel Pepe: "Il Medio Evo Barbarico d'Italia" (The Medieval Evo Barbaric of Italy).

With a naive bias, the author explains that the Germanic and Latin cultures are respectively derived from concepts: negative for the former, positive and ideal for the latter. Should we take this elementary specification seriously (in which an art critic like Pierre Restany also participates) and formalize in its casualness that we Scandinavians would have little choice but to destroy everything that we have in our country that testifies to free progress or to decide that no mea culpa is incumbent on us and, in a completely different frame of mind, deliberately go to war. Determination and initiative to which the Scandinavians have hitherto refused to give themselves, because they consider it the duty of every culture, society, man or nation to keep its own antagonisms to itself and to avoid projecting disturbing distortions on anyone. If the Latins would make the effort to arrive at a more precise awareness of the limits of their principles and truths, all would be at an advantage, and we personally would have the secret joy of having contributed something to this: an immense pride... and no doubt a greater desire to deepen fruitfully the real virtue of these principles and truths.

Books and Literature, as vehicles and means of communication, carry and transmit stupidity as well as intelligence, ignominy as well as moral greatness, lies as well as truth. Apart from any idea of value, they are the very use of human freedom.

Examined from a critical perspective that seeks to encompass and assimilate the shattering phenomena of our times (the fundamental problem of the antagonisms raised by Lupasco), the positions taken by Pepe in "The History of the Barbarians in Italy", or even by Christopher Dawson and Edouard Salin, seem to us not only inoperative, naive and dubious, but also and above all outdated and of an obsolescence that does not even belong to the folklore of the mind or to the catalogue of its amusing finds.

Undoubtedly, the likelihood that spirits from different sides of the spectrum will nourish a need for mutual understanding is slim. Even less likely is the likelihood that such a stream of understanding will flourish between them before blind hostility and ruthless intransigence win them over to each other. These probabilities, which a rational and scrupulous examination reveals to be slight, are however priceless to our hearts; they are one of the points at which our irreducible hope wants to defeat fate.

Although I do not think that Scandinavian methods are likely to arouse interest in France and meet with a large audience there, I have nevertheless chosen and decided to allow them to put forward their attempt to interpret Norman graffiti.

Mr. K.E. Lögstrup, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Aarhus, writes in "Kunst og Etik": "Until now, the positions of philosophical problems have never been so far apart, so completely indifferent to each other, as well as today between philosophy in the Anglo-Saxon world (including Scandinavia) and the philosophy of the continent".

This distressing state of affairs described by Professor Lögstrup has caused me deep concern, which has grown since the end of the war, and has made me so desperate that it is with real relief and real joy that I have finally seen France refuse to commit itself to a united Europe and thus safeguard, for the good of all, the values proper to the 'continent'. It is obvious that the great diversity of opinions between Nordic and Latin minds - especially French ones - is bound to superbly manifest itself and appear in a problem as singular as that of Norman graffiti. These French positions on this problem are represented to a lesser extent than I wished. However, I believe that the attitude of M. de Bouard, of the University of Caen, given the great clarity of his presentation, will allow the reader to get an idea of the differences in perspective between the French and Nordic interpretations. These complementary thoughts could help each other on many issues, because a certain narcissistic and proud drunkenness of Nordic philosophical thought wonderfully balances out certain sadly Cartesian misunderstandings of French philosophical thought. This is a further example of the services that the idea of a desired and accepted complementarity can render.

In "L'Avant-garde Culturelle Parisienne depuis 1945" (Editions Guy Le Prat), Robert Estival doubts the interest of this notion of complementarity in well formulated and apparently logical remarks: "The feeling of sincerity, of love of truth, in art as in science, is introduced into the general dualism of human consciousness, subject-object, and applies to one or the other of these elements. For there seems to be exclusivity at some point. It is either sincerity towards the "I" or sincerity towards the Object, the Work. Everything even seems to happen as if sincerity for one leads to a total or partial artificialization, as the case may be, of the other. »

Rather than trying to really take sides within the dualism that the above statements highlight, we believe that we should prefer another freedom: that of choice according to the opportunity offered by one or the other of these two positions. Since the event we are faced with is the only one that has the force of law for us, we refuse to be the prisoner of any antagonism.

It would be an exaggeration to claim that we have gone too far in interpreting the signs reproduced in this book. However, one thing is certain: according to what Glob thinks, these signs do not predate the erection of the church stones on which they were engraved, the stones having been cut according to their place.

Likewise, in most cases, it is excluded that these graffiti are notes or sketches of builders or builders, because they date from different periods and have been redrawn several times.

Our intention is to publish in a future volume the many drawings left by the builders of the Norwegian wooden churches (the collection of these drawings has been gathered by Dr. Blindheim at the University Museum in Oslo). These signs of builders engraved on wood are very different from those left by the native population of Normandy. Only the Norwegian signs carved by the indigenous population, such as those of Nidaras in Trondhjem, show similarities with their Norman counterparts.

Still with regard to the origin of the Norman signs, we do not believe that we should assume that they were executed by transients, gypsies or soldiers.

In the end, we retain only the hypothesis that the natives were the sole perpetrators. One may wonder about the design pursued by the perpetrators. The study of the links that these signs have with the local saints only gives a partial idea of this. The writings of P. Saintyves are indeed a fundamental part of the dossier. Moreover, the theory of the ex-voto proves to be a very insufficient answer to the problem. Having completed all our examinations, we are inclined to think that the motives of these engravers are of two kinds. In fact, these signs seem to us to have two different orders of meaning: firstly, they are elements of conjuration, invocation, appeal, etc., which relate to exceptional events which do not concern daily life (natural scourges, for example); secondly, they tell the story of the daily routine and are intended to protect and enrich it, and they concern only a regular and cyclical development. There is no doubt that the latter kind of magic refers in a characteristic way to agrarian life.

After Olus Magnus, I have tried to draw attention to the importance of the expression of agrarian life in my book: "The Golden Horns and the Wheel of Fortune" (especially in the chapter "The Rune Staff and the Working Calendar"), There is in the Latin countries a certain lack of interest in the "deepest agrarian revolution that ever affected humanity" (The Neolithic Civilizations of France" by G. G. Bailloud and Migue de Boofzheim) and for concepts relating to art, a lack of interest that seems to us incompatible with this certain notion of the ideality of civilization professed there. Of all the problems raised by Norman graffiti, the most important can be formulated in this question: are these graffiti, as works of art, more important than the acts that gave rise to them? And if so, is their value the work of art itself or the symbol? It seems that the superimposition of the images found makes it possible to exclude the possibility that they were made with the aim of making a work of art in the classical sense of this notion.

In view of the Nordic taste for versatile interpretations, we prefer to refrain from any attempt or attempt to find a more complex symbolism, an undertaking which would be highly likely to be vain and hazardous. Well-known images, such as those in the form of "husdrapa", give rise to countless interpretations that are as poetic as they are fanciful. In "titoli" form, they unleash an avalanche of comments in Italy.

It remains to be seen, therefore, how these graffiti are similar in their authors' motives to what the Americans have claimed to achieve through their "action painting": the importance given to gesture and execution.

This creation of graffiti, often due to a regular repetition of identical gestures, indicates that this is indeed a ritual.

Unlike in Scandinavia and England, where this ritual is religious in nature (as is evidenced by a number of images on the walls of religious buildings, particularly one of a bishop engraving such a sign), the tradition of Norman signs has been perpetuated in secret and is pagan.

Dr Blindheim's studies and ours are far from dispelling the mystery of the Norman signs.

Further study of these reports would require research both in Europe and North Africa, so we invite those who are interested in these matters to give us all the information in their possession and to participate in our research.

The interpretations of Glob and Giessling have aroused opposition from the Latins, which unfortunately it is difficult to imagine that it can be reduced. However, I am pleased to have presented the texts of Glob and Giessling - the irreducible hope that leads us to deny and to consider as null and void predictions that are too cleverly and rationally established and that are often right. So I have a bit of the same good conscience that Heine had when he addressed the French: "I have only good intentions for you, so I will tell you bitter truths. You have more to fear from a liberated Germany than from the entire Holy Alliance, including the Croats and the Cossacks. First of all, they do not like you in Germany, which is almost incomprehensible, because you are very kind ... What exactly they reproach you for, I've never been able to find out. One day, in a tavern in Gôttingue, a young Teutomaniac declared that it was necessary to avenge in the blood of the French the torment of Konradin de Hofenstaufen, whom you beheaded in Naples in 1268. You have certainly forgotten this long ago; but we do not forget anything. You can see that when we feel like fighting with you, we will not lack good reasons. »

The Scandinavians, unlike the Germans, do not have to deal with the French reality; so it is posed to them in another way. Precisely, our love of France and of the French is nourished, enriched and blossomed by qualities that are profoundly different from ours, and your faults, which are also different, are counted for nothing. So for a Scandinavian, being in Paris means living with a certain sense of liberation, no longer feeling the weight of our traditional chains. To those who dream of a new Europe built in the image of the Holy Roman Empire, we must recall another European version whose importance has been confirmed by history: medieval Europe.

There is no doubt that the future of Europe lies in a greater communication of minds, and that the material conquest of these means alone is insufficient. Mutual ignorance is no longer even a crime: it is only a mistake. The false personalisation of responsibilities ultimately engages the responsibility of each of us for reasons of anonymity.

French criticism quickly reaches its limits; it is constantly being sent back to its weakness by its inability to go beyond the narrow confines of the present - criticism that is almost instantaneous and without memory. On the contrary, the Nordic spirit never carries out any critical examination without going back very far into the past in search of information, and so criticism in the North is very fraught with consequences: a real indictment.

French criticism always deliberately finds its limits, but northern criticism never does. Today we believe that there would be a great advantage in harmonizing these various methods of criticism and getting used to their simultaneous use.
