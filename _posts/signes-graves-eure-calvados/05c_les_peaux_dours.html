The oldest chess games in Europe are of Scandinavian origin.

One of them - now in the British Museum - was found on the Isle of Man, and represents a warrior devouring a shield.

This particular type of eater is well known from Viking chronicles. It belonged to a warrior body - the Jomvikings or "single warriors" whose mythical leader was Palna-Thoke, related to both William Tell and Till Eulenspiegel the Madman. The Jomvikings were also known as Ber saerk "the bearskins". They were said to derive their delirious fury from the ab sorption of a drug extracted from a mushroom.

We know that this warlike organization, removed from the authority of kings, played a central and secret role in the Viking conquest of Normandy and England. It seems to me possible to argue that the organization of the Templars was, in fact, a reorganization of the Jomsvikings.

A skillful mix of unscrupulous journalism and remarkable new facts in themselves - the entire work of Gérard de Sède is imbued with a mysticism and esotericism that some would describe as dubious and unpleasant. However, reputed specialists were quick to criticize the lack of seriousness of the positions that the method used by de Sède (also by the review Planète) necessarily institutes. And these specialists to withdraw with dignity.

However, one cannot identify with the "tabloid press" - no reader has ever been mistaken - works that bring something new, true and surprising. Where, according to some suspicious minds, they have done so, we must see a process of purification essential to progress.

Perhaps the fault lies exclusively with the Scandinavians' taste for the literal explanation, but I feel incapable of looking at the fate of the Templars with the seriousness that the French bring to it.

The Knights Templar were the defenders of a theocracy doomed in advance to failure, because it was based on a religion that is not of this world.
