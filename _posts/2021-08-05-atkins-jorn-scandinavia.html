	<p>The author has traced Asger Jorn's artistic development from its beginnings around 1930 to the completion of the 'Silent Myth' cycle in 1953. This group of paintings forms a climax, coming at the end of a very rigorous and prolonged self-imposed apprenticeship, which had lasted twenty-three years. During this period the artist lived in Denmark, though he made numerous trips abroad: to Sweden, Western Europe, and once for six months to Tunisia. In the autumn of 1953 he decided to leave Scandinavia, and this decision proved to be an important turning-point for his art. Since 1953 he has worked mostly in Paris and Albisola, Italy.</p>
	
	<p>Part One examines the various stylistic landmarks of the artist's development, for example his very personal and lyrical series of 'Didaska' paintings and water-colours from the middle 'forties; the 'word pictures' made together with the Belgian poet, Christian Dotremont, at the time of the COBRA movement; the humorous and yet strangely obsessional 'Aganak' sketches of imaginary beasts, which date from a year of extreme poverty and suffering, shortly before the artist underwent a long hospital cure for tuberculosis.</p>
	
	<p>Part Two includes all the paintings by Jorn which it has been possible to discover, dating from 1930 up to the winter of 1953/4. They amount to 855, with a few extra works listed in an appendix. Illustrations accompany the descriptions in practically every case and most of the photographs were commissioned specially for the catalogue.</p>
