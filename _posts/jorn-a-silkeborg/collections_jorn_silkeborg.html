Asger Jorn's collections at the Silkeborg Art Museum date back to 1953. At that time, he worked in a small ceramic workshop in the
Village of Sorring near Silkeborg. The museum had paid the ceramics workshop a modest sum for the payment of Jorn's fees and obtained in exchange the authorization to choose a certain number of works when they were finished. On the occasion of this purchase, Jorn gave some drawings, etchings and lithographs. Then he promised that in future he would donate his own work to the museum and that he would also give it the gifts offered by his friends.

In 1958, Jorn systematically began to collect the works of his contemporaries in Europe and artists whose work was a source of inspiration for him. Towards the end of this year, the exhibition "Nouvel Art International" opened with around a hundred works.

In his introduction, Jorn expresses some of his ideas about these collections, whose expansion and choice of subjects are unique in Europe. He did not seek to create a *"general orientation on the most modern art, where no more than a collection of valuable masterpieces, but largely cheap graphic works, and only a few rare works are part of leading works. This small collection is more of a provocation than an expression of my appreciation of Danish art. How and why, is a question to which every person interested in art in Scandinavia, must, themselves, answer.*

*The pieces of a museum are memories, and in my opinion, these belong to my time. Time will demonstrate if they are something else, and more than memories. It was Frederik Dam who gave me my first indelible impression of the grandeur of modern Danish art. I saw my universe. It was in Silkeborg in 1933. (-) As long as he lived, he was my art dealer. It was he who, in 1938, organized my first exhibition, in the company of the French painter Pierre Wemaëre.*

*During one of my numerous economic crises, he took charge of Fernand Léger's paintings, exhibited here, which my master  had given me. Léger had given me some gouaches that I intended to reproduce in "Politikens Magasin", accompanied by a description of the work done for the large Léger canvas "The Transport of Forces", intended for the Palais de la Découverte for the International Exhibition of 1937. They were never reproduced and it was impossible to sell them despite the hottest recommendations from Lundstrøm and Poul Henningsen. Later they disappeared.*

*The canvases that Dam had undertaken were not intended for reproduction. They were not even signed because Léger did not like them. He gave them to me one day when I had nothing to paint on and he himself was comparatively penniless. Back home, I was unable to use them as a canvas. I found them too good.*

*It is also Léger that offered me Franz Kafka’s novel "The Castle" and it is thus that I discovered this great literary work, which would not have existed today if Kafka’s friend, Max Brod had followed his instructions and burned the manuscripts. It is difficult to find two ways of understanding art that are as far apart as Fernand Léger's and those that characterize students like Pierre Wemaëre and myself. What Léger despised and fought through his paintings, the tone of colors, the purity of the material, and the personal character of the brushstroke, all he hated like the plague and eliminated, where possible, all this was the basis of my artistic form. Is it so weird that what I like most about Leger's paintings is what he did not like. Many connoisseurs share my opinion. But it may be a sign of the times. For Léger, painting a canvas was a mechanical process, which could very well be performed by a disciple, provided, of course, that he was very disciplined. But when my own needs went beyond the training, he pitilessly overwhelmed me with insults. This classic use of the disciples was in perfect accord with his conception of the social work of an artist. Although he was anti-religious, he had to do good work for the church. I gradually gained the deepest respect for his artistic conduct, although his is different from mine. I did not learn anything from Léger's teaching, but his personality definitely marked me as an artist and to explain this represents for me the most natural introduction to an exhibition of this part of modern art that had importance for me".*

A series of exhibitions followed during the sixties in Silkeborg, all organized by Jorn. He concentrated on engravings and lithographs of his contemporaries. This led to exhibitions with almost complete collections of the engraved work of Jean Dubuffet (1961 and 1965), Alechinsky (1964), and Matta (1969). We must add more than one hundred drawings and watercolors by Henri Michaux (1962), paintings and drawings by Pierre Wemaëre (1963) and the Danish symbolist painter Johannes Holbek (1965). Jorn also regularly sent his own canvases, drawings, ceramics and engravings, and in 1964, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the latter, the museum organized an exhibition of all the works offered until then by Jorn. In 1968 Jorn donated his masterpiece "Stalingrad" to the museum. Many of his gifts, however, have an intimate character, they are often small canvases, improvisations and sketches. Jorn did not want to dominate the collection. He explained the purpose of these donations in a letter to the museum in 1961: "I could have borrowed more interesting works from Dubuffet and others. But I have established the principle that the museum will never exhibit anything other than the works that belong to it. We already have Louisiana and the Modern Museum in Stockholm, which are organizing exhibitions to make people aware of new trends. I want to cooperate with the Silkeborg Museum, because that is where I can make the public understand what I like and what I find, for the moment, important; not because I want to be a judge of art and quality, but simply to show what a particular and limited group thinks is important."

The museum presents abstract-spontaneous art from its origins and evolution. Jorn takes his starting point in the compositions of figures of the eighteenth century and passes over the nineteenth to reach the symbolists: Redon, Ensor and Kubin. German Expressionism is among others represented by Max Beckmann, Corinth, Dix and Nolde. According to Jorn, symbolism and expressionism were the basis of abstract-spontaneous art. The works of Man Ray, Jean Arp, Picabia and Max Ernst emphasize the importance of surrealist influence on Danish art. From there, Jorn follows his own era and the artistic groups in which he himself exerts an influence: first Danish painting before and during the war, then the ramifications of this painting on the post-war European scene with Cobra, and the circle of artists grouped in Italy around ceramics workshops in Albisola during the fifties. According to Jorn, Wols and Pollock marked, in this period, the extreme limits of the development of painting: in the donations we find almost all the engravings of Wols.

In the last years, Jorn added works by Cuban painter Feijoo and a collection of Japanese kites. In this "raw art" or in the art of "intimate banalities", seen in a global way, one finds the last perspective he has managed to present at the Silkeborg Museum.
