The modern man's attitude towards art would certainly have been completely foreign to the medieval viewer. That is not to say that what we call an aesthetic experience in and of itself may have been excluded. But it was not consciously perceived by the medieval man as an isolated intrinsic value. The value of the art was, on the one hand, associated with the kind of craftsmanship with which the work was performed and, on the other, with the degree of vivacity and the ability to experience that the image could awaken. In such circumstances, the aesthetic norm has no formal character but is part of the work's design of the expression, which would be a realization of the human situation in the present and in eternity.

The majority of the Romanesque stone art we find here should therefore primarily be seen as more or less speaking expressions of the then man's relation to and perception of the immediate reality in which she lived. We will meet at one time ambiguous and straightforward storytelling art in varying forms, sometimes unbound and naively immediate and sometimes chastened and strained sincerely in their quest to be the however existing fashion at hand. At the same time, we must be aware that nothing came of mere play, nothing was done for its own sake or as an outlet solely for the stone carver's will to manifest a form. Even the simple and naive had a meaning for the time, which, in its immediacy, also speaks to us and thereby constitutes evidence of the modesty's ability to find and shape an expression of feeling and experience. Let us try, in so far as we can free ourselves from normative form and expression patterns, to initially consider the image as it in itself appears to still convey the experience of reality that was valid then but existential even now.

In the human figure, we often encounter a trait of sadness. As a kind of demanding basic feature, this is primarily expressed through the image of Christ. This seriousness can be felt in the heavily stylized form as a pervasive highness or as a somewhat trumpet severity. We are caught by this sculpture's direct speech to us primarily through the images in which Christ believes and with the eyes fixes the spectator. In representations of baptism, on the other hand, Christ is frontal towards us, but at the same time is in a peculiar way passive towards the spectator and also the act that is going on, since it is the act as a whole that has significance. A strange exception is found in a baptismal scene, in which John the Baptist, for a moment oblivious of his sacred solicitude, stares at the viewer, not appealed, but with an unbridled curiosity, who also infected themselves with Christ. He has thereby broken his isolation towards the viewer, not to urge him but to marvel at his presence. As a prerequisite for this our interpretation of the scene, there is certainly no awareness of the stone master who performed the image. Rather, it should be the simple and human instant of his perception of the event, which causes us to experience this effect. At the same baptismal fountain there is a representation of the holy three kings, who in the same way seem to be more interested in us than of the child they progress to pay homage to.

Thus, the contact between the figure or the stage and the other spectator has been achieved with different means of expression, but is for the most part obvious to the hand. When a person wants to focus our attention on himself or what he wants to say, it is usually done through a gesture or by means of the big eyes that do not want to escape. But we also find examples of the fact that an intimate contact can be achieved through an almost frivolous unfathomability reflected in the facial features.

We also find the contradictions in the narrative scenes. A dignified and measured solemnity meets us primarily in the Passion scenes of the New Testament but also in the praise scenes in connection with Jesus' birth history, but in the very birth scenes the spectator immediately becomes more engaged. The thoughtful Joseph invites us, under still reason, to partake of the wonder in the cave, if not as frantic as the donkey and the ox, so with the zeal and joy that characterizes the shepherds and their animals.

Directly upon the people, some stone masters have gone into their depiction of the Fall and its consequences. Here we meet the direct identification between the spectator and the figure, no doubt a tangible experience for the medieval viewer but also with address to us, if we are sensitive enough to perceive it. With an ill-concealed calculation, Eva receives the fruit of the snake, and Adam puts his teeth into it with an unrestrained almost animal desire. When the pair then cultivate the earth outside the garden of paradise, the trumpeted Adam looks incomprehensible and inquiring at Eve, who, with a half vulgar grin, seems content with the new situation. At another baptismal font, she shows herself more morally, where she is somewhat bored but proudly sitting with her dragonfly. Adam, on the other hand, is completely burdened not only by the carpentry he is doing but mainly by the grief,

The body in itself has not had any interest in the Romanesque stone master. When the difference between the naked Adam and Eve is to be made, it is not by the sex but by the length of the hair. The costume, on the other hand, can often be meticulously designed, since it characterizes the people in most cases and, for the statists, is made up of time's own costumes, either the events played out over a thousand years ago, without bound to the time, or in close connection with the stone master's own time. In this way, the viewer perceived the events that were recorded as current and significantly present. But the costume can also be freely designed and through its ornamental form provide a definite chord as the basis for the emotional mood that the figure or stage intends to reflect. When the old Simeon in the temple sees and touches the child of Jesus, the figures as a whole are characterized by a quiet dignity, but the movement that the event evokes can be clearly followed in the schematically drawn soft wave movements, which, starting from Mary's mantle and over the sweeping of the Jesus child, turn into a whirl over Simeon's left side. A solemnity, a transformation of the figures into signs of dignity for the act they perform, on the other hand, produces the large and summarily sculpted mantles, in which the three holy kings are depicted on a baptismal font. In the following image with the same motive, one can notice how the sculptors at the end of the era with an intrusive will for factual realism and at the same time a deeper relief instead achieved a naive identification - the exalted universal validity is gone. can be clearly followed in the schematically drawn soft wave movements, which, starting from Mary's mantle and over the sweeping of the Jesus child, turn into a whirl over Simeon's left side.

Along with the costume, the underneath merely thought or imagined bodies often form a rhythmic ornament to depict a movement as in the three Marios at Christ's tomb. To emphasize the warm feeling of belonging between Maria and Elisabeth at their meeting, the sculptor has brought the bodies together in a great shape. Here we can also see what happens when the sculptural naturalism is increased, through the distance between the figures, the emotion-depiction can be observed, but in the earlier art of expression it is felt.

The couples, who embrace each other at the baptismal point in Tryde, let us sense their affinity through another means, the gesture, which is one of the most important bearers of the time. The long and narrow arms, which have been made without the slightest claim to anatomical truth, wrap themselves around the figures, binding them to one another, while the hands only indicate a tender gesture. In the over-dimensioning of the arm and hand movements often lies the dramatic sequence of events. Such is the case in the interaction of hands, which in a representation of Adam's creation signifies the very thing. The gesture can also be of a purely attributive nature. In a naïve form, we experience how an angel, set to guard the gate to heavenly Jerusalem, with childlike zeal holds his key with a significantly extended arm.

What primarily appeals to the spectator in the human figures is the head, usually enlarged but in itself gathering all the force which the figure must express, whether this force is of an active nature or filled with reason and seriousness. With a certain accompaniment of the gestures of the hands lies the expressive power of the scene in the fig. 217 depicted communion scene gathered in the faces. Even in the strong stylization, the various characters and the varying emotional moods that control the actions are felt. Here, as in most other portrayals of humanity, it is the eyes that most intensely convey the contact both between the figures acting within the image and between them and the spectator. The latter also applies in cases where the formal simplification has been pushed to its peak.

Even more intensely, the expressive power of the human face comes to us when it is isolated and freshly sculpted from the portals of the portals or the bases of the baptisms. Usually it is hardly a person anymore, even though the picture has had to borrow her figure. Instead, we are faced with a concrete embodiment of the demons that sat in the possession of man, and who, through the clearly stated malice in the angry eyes, the grinning teeth and the protruding chin, intend to ward off the evil, the body itself.

The restlessness pours out of the shut-out mouth on the personalized load, as well as the sensual well-being, Luxoria's face will swell as she slides the snakes. The personalized loads are not formally tamed, they are consumed by their own loadability. The indeterminate demons, on the other hand, who can sneak up on us at an unguarded moment, are often held by arms, which pull on the mustaches of the face, the twisted rope, which popular belief saw as a magical spring. In formal terms, the distance is not so great between the idolatry which once on the wall of the church stave off the wicked grants of its pagan counterparts, and the pious bishop who received the people at the entrance to the same church. But through the rustic power of the face drawn between the shoulders in one case and the dignified dignity of the bishop's face in the other, however, representatives of two different worlds meet us. For the contemporary viewer, these two worlds were extremely real and at one time present, not just side by side but sometimes even in one and the same form. When man was allowed to lend his port to the demon or devil, then her ears grew like horns.

But it was mainly in the shape of the beast or the fabled beast that the spectator met the evil. A belief in the devilishness behind the thing might have been able to get a tangible concretisation in the encounter with the huge jaw, which threatensly extends to the viewer, while the winding and forward-whipping tail of the vicious monster gives way to the insidious intent to devour a wavering soul. The devil in his own person, when he is supposed to help Simon Magus jump from the tower, in comparison with the figures he has mastered almost ridiculously menless. He makes a grotesque figure imprisoned and defeated, but when in the shape of the lion or beast between his huge jaws he crushes the menless lamb or with snakes as auxiliaries in the process of devouring a human, it takes place in the powerful sculptural form with such intensity, that he thereby binds and wards his own power but at the same time constitutes a warning sign for the viewer. With a sneak peek at his helpless victim, he gets the spectator to experience the event not just as a one-off phenomenon but as something happening now.

But not all beasts need to be the bearers of evil. Above all, the lion can also represent the opposite, and above all, with its powerful figure, it gains the body strength when it carries the columns upon which the church rests. When the cruelty penetrates us from the animals which were unknown and dangerous to man, we encounter greater charm and almost love in the production of the animals with which man surrounded himself and who were her friends. In this respect, the horse, as the then human being, is in many cases indispensable servants the foremost place. The three wise men ride to Bethlehem on their stately foxes, and when the holy family fled to Egypt, the Nordic stone-master could not imagine that it would have happened on a donkey, but placed Mary and the child on a magnificent horse, as worthy and safe for them away from Herod's murderous appropriations. The close relationship between the horse and his master is portrayed with the presently quite unusual, almost lyrical experience. Behind the kneeling bend Eustachius, his horse takes on an elegant complacency in his movement, which will be directly confronted by the apparently strong bond of the time to his indispensable animal. The compassion can be expressed in the freer sculpture in an almost welded form between rider and horse.

As with the horse, it is often obvious that the accuracy of the thing is depicted. It also happens in close connection with contemporary conditions. If a ship is present, it connects with its animal-headed rods close to the Viking ships of the indigenous tradition. The event the ship depicts or the symbolic function it possesses in this way becomes more immediately present. The same applies to the periodical costumes of everyday, warlike, royal or liturgical incisions. The individual objects, which directly say something about the significance of the situation, have been clearly emphasized. Since Adam and Eve were driven out of paradise and forced into hard work, Adam has begun to swing the heavy carpenter's ax and Eve twist the wool with her dragonfly, pursuits with which the viewer was completely familiar, and who made him or her identify his or her own situation with the elders of the ancestors. But the tool has also been clarified to stand as a sign of acts of less everyday kind, of acts of far-reaching importance in the Christian history of salvation. With the raised sword, King Herod announces his command of the child murder in Bethlehem. The rope with which Christ is imprisoned is brought before Pilate, appears with greater acuity and faithfulness than the bodies of the acting figures. The hammer and nail in the hand of the man at the cross of Christ do not primarily serve in a concrete act, Christ is already nailed at the cross, yes he is already dead, Longinus has just been hit by the water and blood, the hammer and the nail radiating from Christ's side wound held by any human being,

In all, the Romanesque stone art we stand here has a meaning and significance in addition to the factual depiction. The ornaments themselves are not mere or perhaps even primarily ornamental but represent symbolically transcendent concepts. The palm trees and grapevines on the shells of the baptisms are reminiscent of the life-giving water. The closed ring chain from a crest is the image of eternity in which everything is linked and to which life in the form of the palmette is connected. For safety's sake, a holy man with a demanding gesture points to the abstract image while his straight eyes are drawing our attention to him.

Everything that the Romanesque stone sculptor has depicted has, in the broadest sense, a religious foundation. The ability to experience Christianity, which had not been inhabited in the area for much more than a hundred years, as a reality bound to the present and the thing, probably did not pose too great difficulties to the people, whose not-too-distant ancestors during pagan times stood in a often markedly related to the powers they believed to see and experience in nature and its systems. Now the lists had changed and the essential focus of human endeavor had become a different one. But the perceived power of both the concrete presence of the good and the evil was equally noticeable. We have seen how in the picture it has been possible to put it in direct confrontation with the sacred or devilish things. In the scenes as a whole, the identification was not as strong, their purpose was demonstrative, narrative, defining, but the artist has not objectively freed himself from what he portrays. This is experienced in the individuals. With a religious motivation in his choice of image, the stone master has rarely produced current documents. Occasionally, it has happened, as in the baptism scene, which occurs at a funfair. But the action of the scene is purely liturgical and it is directly tied to the object being used. But with the presence of the stage, they are directly involved in the sacramental act at baptism. which occurs at a funt.

Among biblical representations, it is primarily Adam and Eve's history, especially their work, that may have had an identifiable effect on the spectator. Most importantly, it is mainly the non-biblical scenes that may have appealed to the viewer and his own situation. Not least, this may be the case if the learning scenes also appear to be linked to old Nordic values. The perception of the more or less glorious way of dying may possibly be reflected in a difficult-to-interpret scene. On the coup for a baptismal find two death scenes on either side of a ship. On the right side a man who dies the death of the dead, the martyr's death, and whose soul is brought to heaven by an angel; The pillar with the weather head behind the bed also gossips that his soul in the form of a small naked man is not, as in the former case, brought to the height but to a lower realm of death. A serious sadness characterizes the participating people, but above all the little distressed soul, who with his head on the oblique appeals to the spectator to think about his life. Thematically, the scenes certainly refer directly to certain motifs, which have been lost to us, and which, perhaps, for the viewers of the time were also unknown. But what happened through his grouping in relation to the other clearer symbolic representations at the point had a tangible connection to a normal world of performance. but above all the little distressed soul, which with its head obliquely appeals to the spectator to ponder his life.

Should all of these images make a strong impression on us today by activating our feeling and imagination, how much more intensely should they not have acted on contemporary people. In their murky everyday environment, the stone sculpture must already have been something enormous in itself, and in addition it served as a material embodiment of what many today want to call ideas and powers, but which the medieval man experienced as reality.
