Who the masters of Skåne's many stone sculptures were or where they came from, we have no direct information on. The fact that the leading sculptors at the cathedral were taken from southern Europe, probably Italy, should not be in doubt. But there is therefore no reason to believe that the stone masters who enriched the land churches would, except in exceptional cases, have been taken from foreign countries. Here, as well as in other parts of Europe, most of the sculptors were at least anonymous in the earlier part of the Middle Ages. However, there are always exceptions, and so was the case among the Scanian stone masters. On the tympanum field across the entrance to the island of Herrestad, one can still clearly read the words: "Stone master Carl cut this stone." It has been generally assumed that this stone master Carl did not sculpt only that stone, on which the inscription is found but also the portal scope as a whole. Based on the sculptural ornaments found around the portal, a long series of sculptures have been compiled in mainly southeastern Skåne, but also in the middle parts of the landscape, sculptures considered by Carl. Although not everything attributed to Carl can be considered to have been performed by him, however, through the signature we have a testimony of a stone master of certainly Nordic and well Scanian origin. The fact that he got his name attached to one of the works may indicate that he had a local fame and enjoyed a reputation, which probably did not always come to the fore even the most skilled artist or craftsman during this time.

Carl's stonemason's signature has only been found once, but at about the same time during the latter part of the 12th century there was also another Scanian sculptor, who signed a whole series of baptisms. On the edge of the cup he has carved with runes: "Mårten (Martin) made me." Many of the baptismal finds, which can be attributed to him by means of the signature or stylistically, the cup is usually merely ornamentally sculpted, but it rests in many cases. on Mårten's characteristic lion figures. The fact that the runes came into use in the inscription is not in itself unusual. Throughout the Middle Ages, in many cases, it was the layman's normal writing, primarily for shorter messages or calls. However, this does not exclude the fact that the runes may at the same time have traditionally added some magical significance. When Lund Cathedral's restaurateur Adam van Duren, as late as the beginning of the 16th century, opens one of his many inscriptions engraved in the cathedral with the words "God help", these two words are only executed in runes.

Marten's signature on the baptismal font may have been of the same significance as Carl's signature, but it should not be unlikely that in the main room, with the help of the magical runes, he might have wanted to attach a call to the sacramental functional objects, which at least for this time constituted the baptismal font. It is also not essential in this context that it is the object, the fun, that speaks through the wording. The Master of Stone may have put some of his soul into the work, so that it would remind him of the coming family in connection with the sacrament of baptism.

The third in a row known by the name of Skåne stone master Tove. He has, as in passing, inscribed his name among the texts that accompany the representations on the baptismal point in Gumlösa. His works should have been carried out during essentially the 1190s. As a result, our knowledge also ends with the names of Scanian stone masters from Roman times. They have each made their names appear in different ways, perhaps for different motives. One, however, they have in common, namely the Nordic names, who clearly say that it was now the country's own artists, who most often helped not only to decorate with their sculptures but also to give a symbolic meaning to the parish churches of the landscape. When reviewing the images, the reader soon finds that most reproduce baptisms or details thereof. This seemingly quantitative overweight for a particular object group is not temporary. In the Skåne countryside, the richest and in many ways the most interesting early medieval stone art is manifested primarily on the foundations. Nor is there any country in Europe where, within a certain area, such a wealth of Romanian baptismal remains have been preserved as in Skåne and Gotland.

We can note that there have been workshops that have produced a large number of similar fonts, but even so, the diversity of the different types encountered is nevertheless significant. They are gossiping about an unbound activity with varying impulses, while at the same time possessing a striking originality in relation to the stock from the rest of Europe. This originality is expressed not only in the forms but also in the diverse and rich picture world that we encounter in them.

From the point of view of art history it has been clarified what is meant by the concept of Romanesque style. There is no doubt that this presented Scanian stone sculpture belongs to this style group. However, it differs at the same time from much of the visual art that is found elsewhere from the same era and is thus easily recognizable if it is found exported outside Skåne's own borders. Paradoxically, however, it is not a common Scanian style feature that makes the strongest impression, but rather the distinct stylistic differences between the various Scanian stone masters and the workshops. It is in this diversity that artistic wealth lies. It is remarkable to what extent the individual master here has independently and naturally found himself corrected with both subject and form, while elsewhere one can occasionally find how this art may have had a certain stereotypical feel. If the Scanian Romanesque stone sculpture has its own face, it is primarily in this richness of variation that it gives it its distinctive place in the European art of the era. Technology and, not least, craftsmanship played a major role in the medieval art practice, it also forms the basis for a number of the works presented here, but it is, however, primarily the artist behind the works, that made them speak to us. The current receptivity of this may, to some extent, have its basis in the contemporary perception of personality, but only as the introduction to an acquaintance; Ultimately and with greater validity, it is the humility behind the creation that makes the experience of the images become reality.

The natural stone sculpture, for natural reasons, as opposed to art objects of perishable material, has had a greater opportunity to be preserved for our days. However, this does not prevent that what we can still admire and enjoy today is only part of what once existed. In the Middle Ages, older sculptures appear to have been extensively used in conjunction with rebuilding of the lots in which the pictures were originally placed. They have been used in a later masonry, perhaps lost their original symbolic function but possibly got a new one, but above all they must have been appreciated as a picture. What the Reformation in the Nordic countries meant for the visual arts in the churches we do not yet know enough about. However, it would probably not have been too great a change in relation to the thing and the image for ordinary people. With some exception, Skåne was also spared from the image-storming, which was so prevalent in some parts of Europe. More fateful for the medieval churches and their fixtures became the 18th century and much of the 19th century. During the latter century, the prosperity and wealth of some villages became a direct cause for the destruction of the medieval churches in connection with the construction of new and larger churches. Many sculptures were scattered during this time, baptisms were used for flower pots in gardens, other sculptures disappeared completely, but some remained in hiding places. From there, they were retrieved at the beginning of this century, when a new understanding and a new interest began to awaken to the old clan nodes. What was then collected from ruined churches in Skåne is preserved today in Lund University's historical museum.
