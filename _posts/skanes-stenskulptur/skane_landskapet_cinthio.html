During the centuries immediately following the birth of Christ, the Romans began to get to know the adventurous countries at the northern edge of the ocean. Among the large islands that came into contact with this, one especially named Scandia, because of its fertility and residence of significant tribes, has made a strong impression on the travelers, geographers and historians of history. That in reality Scandia was not an island but a peninsula it was not yet clear to them. There is now no doubt that the Scandia one encountered in the first place was the present Skåne. But the name Scandia or Scandinavia, as it was sometimes written, became for the Romans a designation of the entire Scandinavian peninsula, a designation which then fell into oblivion but resumed in a new era and came to include Denmark.


*The landscape and the historical environment*

To this day, Skåne occupies a distinctive position among other Scandinavian regions in several respects. As the southernmost foothold of the Scandinavian peninsula and an old Danish part of the country, it is an important link between the continent and the High North. The landscape owns the fertile soil, the large forests, the rolling plains and the marked rocky mountain ridges. But Skåne owns above all the sea. On three sides it is surrounded by water, and the greatest distance from one coast to the other does not exceed 100 km. The surrounding sea is not wide and has always been navigable. It has not been a dividing line but a connecting link open to the east, west and south. The real boundary goes to the north in the large and forcibly forced forests towards Småland and Sweden.

Skåne's natural wealth, which has always been a source of the prosperity of the landscape, has made it sought after for the neighboring kingdoms. The mild climate and the good soil have favored agriculture, whose representatives from the Stone Age and up to our time have been carriers of Scanian culture. The sea has provided plenty of fish, which in particular during the Middle Ages with the great herring fishing became a major European commodity.

From ancient times, Scania has a certain distinctive character, which is related to the nature of the landscape and the general conditions. Even today, there is something paradoxical in the Scanian gender that is a clear openness to the outside world paired with thoughtfulness, sometimes suspicion of the foreign. Scania is willing to make as much as possible on the basis of future impulses, but in such a way that its own tradition is not lost. In line with this, it follows that his speech is often ambiguous and can still confuse the Swelling.

Because of these strange conditions in a region, which is jokingly called its own kingdom, the traditional expressions have never been molded. The varied landscape with its different life forms means that Skåne cannot be taken or described in a clear way. The uniqueness of the landscape lies precisely in the paradoxes, to which is added a certain form of ambivalence in Scania. He can when he wants, but he can also let things depend, when life is not threatened, on a paradoxical union of energy and laziness. Spiritually, this basic attitude is a prerequisite for active action and the form of the form from the rationale.

The fact that the present collection of images has been taken solely from this landscape has become a natural consequence of the Skåne-owned character despite the diversity. You find the monuments preserved from a bygone era so tightly that you often do not have to move more than a few kilometers to get from one to the other. To some extent, this monument stock differs from that found in other parts of the Nordic region, but in its overall nature it gives from a central and limited area a particularly representative image of the Romanesque Nordic stone sculpture. In time, the presented sculpture spans only slightly more than a hundred years, from about 1100 to a piece into the 13th century.

The Viking Age and the oldest Middle Ages certainly possessed a native monumental stone art, but its overall character and function were essentially distinct from Romanesque church art. Dene's stone sculpture was based on entirely new conditions. It was bound to the churches and formally legitimized by its connection to the notions of the Christian Church. However, this relationship does not rule out that much was inherited. The images were created during a time when the Christian world of performances was still relatively new in the Nordic countries. At the same time, for the individual person and her view of the thing and the picture the transition from old to new should not have been too great. She still lived in a tangible contact with the reality in which the image also constituted a tangible figure. But this reality was not primarily confined to being measurable in identity with the natural form. It was a reflection of the intangible and an experience of her own life in and as an expression of the contrast-filled combination of crass realism and supernatural dependence.

During the Middle Ages, Skåne was the most important landscape among the eastern Danish provinces. Already early after the creation of the Danish kingdom during the 8oo and the 900s, the kings realized the importance of being able to dominate the landscape. Knut the Great City of Lund founded a section in the 11th century. This was done for economic political reasons in order to benefit from trade here and control the most important road connections in connection with one of the largest marketplaces in the landscape. A coin factory grew in the city and a number of craftsmen and traders gathered there. It was during a time when most of Skåne's population must still have been pagan. Eventually, Christianity began to gain a foothold in the landscape, especially in Lund, where it is believed that the king had already erected a wooden church early. The missionaries and bishops, who then worked in the landscape,
One can probably expect that Knut's interest in Skåne and Lund may have been dictated by his plans to make the landscape a central area for the entire Nordic region's extensive empire, which he sought to add to his Danish-English kingdom. However, the plans were never fully realized, not least because of the compromise regarding the Danish church's sound position during Hamburg-Bremen, which was the result of Knut's meeting with the Pope and the German emperor, Konrad II, on his visit to Rome 1027. However, the first initiative may have had a fundamental impact on the continued development of Skåne's position as such a power-political support point in Danish national policy, especially as long as the efforts of kings and churches went hand in hand.

Already Knut the Store's father, Sven Tveskägg, had laid the foundation for Skåne's acquisitions of goods, which in particular Knut's sister Estrid developed and may have taken refuge. Here her son, Sven Estridsen, can also be thought to have spent certain periods not only during his youth but also since he became king. As such, he resumed the earlier struggle for the liberation of the Danish Church from the German Archbishop. When Sven Estridsen set up two bishopric seats in Skåne in 1060, one of them, in Lund, came to be occupied by an Englishman in accordance with the general aspirations. In contrast, the second bishop's seat, in Dalby, right next to Lund, was occupied by a German, Egino, who, after six years, moved to Lund, since the first bishop died there.

The bishop's seat in Dalby was demolished and the stone church begun was probably not completed until afterwards. The remains of the oldest building, the first known stone church in Skåne, are somewhat puzzling given the political intentions of the initiator Sven Estriden. The rugged but religious-political-nature character of the Basilica of Pillar was of a German type with ideological preconditions in Ottoman building art. Did it represent the King's remission of the Hamburg-Bremen Archbishopric or did it represent a visible manifestation of Sweden's supremacy towards the German Emperor and the German Church underlined by the use of the opponent's own symbols of power? Given the king's continued concern for the church, even after it lost its bishop and became a canon church, the latter alternative seems the most likely.

According to Adam of Bremen, as early as the 1070s, Skåne would have had about 300 churches. Whether this number is true or just a result of the claimants' desire to impress is impossible to determine - Adam was in Denmark but probably not in Skåne. However, the churches that existed must all have been erected in wood. But after the arrival of the two Episcopal churches, other stone churches have probably begun to be erected as well. No preserved sculptures from either the oldest church in Dalby or the only archaeologically known first bishop's church in Lund have survived.

For many, the word Lund has become equivalent to its cathedral. When during the last half of the nooo, without any competition, it rose above all that the city could otherwise offer of buildings, the name must have meant even more a concept for the church building and what it represented. It should hardly have been obvious that the Nordic church center would be located in Lund. The city seems to have developed favorably since it was founded by Knut the Great in the 1020s, but it was nevertheless on the periphery of the Danish empire. Already King Knut, however, seems to have attached great importance to his innovation, which, mainly in his Latin form, could easily be confused with the king's largest city in the western part of his empire, namely London. Among the many places where Knut had started the first domestic Danish coin mint, Lund has occupied the foremost place without comparison. Nor did the following kings let the production decline at the city's mint, which was probably in close proximity to the royal estate.

However, if Lund appears to have been in a strong economic development during most of the 1000s, the city has not been able to assert itself in ecclesiastical terms during this period vis-à-vis certain East Danish cities. No own bishop got Skåne until 1060, and when Knut the Great's sister Estrid built a stone church in Roskilde around 1030, which was later converted to a larger one by Bishop Svend in the 1070s, there were still only stave churches available in Lund. Conditions were again changed on a royal initiative. In the 1080s, Knut II, later the Holy One, built a stone church dedicated to St. Laurentius. It was probably started as a royal farm church, but the king left it to the bishop and the chapel, which could come about through his generous donations to the church.

Favored by the Pope's opposition to the German emperors, King Erik Ejegod and the Lund bishop Ascer finally succeeded in detaching the Danish church from the sovereignty of Hamburg-Bremen with joint efforts. This happened during the very first years of the 12th century, and in 1104 Ascer could be covered with the pallet. He thus became not only archbishop of Denmark but also primed all over the Nordic region. It is very likely, among other things, because of this institutional dignity that was sought from the outset and the thus-achieved position of power that the archbishop's seat was assigned to Lund in Skåne, the part of Denmark that had the most central position with regard to contacts with and control of the Scandinavian peninsula. It was in church power politics the same way, which Knut the Store had done for general political purposes just a hundred years earlier, when the city of Lund was founded. When, at the end of the century, Saxo Grammaticus would justify why Lund was chosen as the archdiocese, he stated, among other things, that "from neighboring areas you can easily get there. The roads are many on land and to water.”
Archbishop Ascer descended from one of the Danish grandmothers' netherlands of peasant genus, from which both kings and bishops were recruited. The rough features of these men receive a monumental reflection in the earliest parts of Lund's cathedral, for which the first impulses were taken from traditional Western Europeans. The oldest parts of the mighty crypt room are in themselves sculptural designs, the picture is missing, the concrete symbolic designs are, as in the columns of the sanctuary, still only ornamentally expressed.

With the significance that Lund gained through the establishment of the archdiocese, Skåne's history came for slightly more than a hundred years, that is, precisely the time this picture material spans, to become its bishops in large parts. On significant points we know this story through the written source material. But also the thing, and to these which belongs the sculptural world, is a form of source material for the knowledge of the individual's perception of his existence. Before we try to read any of these, however, some of the more tangible situations must be drawn.

In 1137, Ascer succeeded the Archbishop's throne by Eskil. He seems to have been a man of a completely different kind from his predecessor. Eskil was admittedly nephew to this, but unlike Ascer, who had been mainly focused on maritime Western Europe, Eskil had a particularly lively contact with continental Europe. With Bernhard of Clairvaux he was a close friend, and when Eskil resigns from his archdiocese after many dramatic lives in the 1170s, he travels to Clairvaux, where he ends his life in 1182. The political history in Denmark during Eskil's time was particularly confused because of the constant struggles between alternating faithful dependents with one another in close kinship. The church's relationship with the royal power had been good in the past. Eskil was European even in the sense that as a person he came to take part in the great disputes of the time between state and church. In his cautious but nonetheless attempt to assert the Church's independent position in Denmark, he was repeatedly involved in the political battles surrounding the kings.

But despite the troubled times, through Eskil's personal initiative, a new and fruitful cultural policy developed, laying the foundations for not least a Skåne in the European community. The cathedral was completed in a new building phase, which brought with it a rich sculptural decoration, and in 1145 the high altar was inaugurated. For the propagation of the cultural fruits of Christianity, monasticism in its various forms played perhaps the most prominent role. As a monastic founder, Eskil could not be surpassed by any other Danish bishop. Prior to his time, there was only a Benedictine monastery in Lund in Skåne and Dalby, which was taken over by Dalby in the early 1100s. In obvious agreement with his friendship with France and Bernhard of Clairvaux, the Archbishop introduced the Cistercians into the country and the first monastery was founded in 1144 in Herrevad in Skåne. However, it became another order that Eskil mainly came to favor in Skåne, namely the premonstrations. He let no less than four monasteries of this order grow up, in Tommarp, Öved, Lund and Vä. Certainly it was of great importance that the Premonstratens, as well as the Cistercians, in addition to their spiritual activities, also had a practical orientation, but in addition, for the Premonstratens monastery, they could be placed in a city. This was the case not only in Lund but also in Tommarp and Vä. Characteristic of the monastery of this order was also that they obeyed directly under the bishop,

With Archbishop Eskil, Lund and Skåne came into direct contact with French culture. This was done not only through Eskil's personal relations and trips to France, but also through the newly founded orders, which were based on it. The once established contact continued during the following bishops, and the French cultural influences, in addition to the older heritage, became of vital importance to the intellectual flourishing of the late 12th century.

The four first and most significant archbishops of the Lund Foundation were among themselves quite different types, with each having their distinctive features. Ascer seems to have been a safe and without force powerful man, who with his person conveyed the old heritage to the pioneering new age. Eskil was the great church innovator with wide connections. His successor from 1179, Absalon, was primarily a politician at both the church level and not least at the general political level. In contrast to Eskil, he was in direct friendly relation to the royal power, which, through King Valdemar I, had already stabilized at the end of Eskil's episcopal period.

As a minister of the king, Absalon was at times more concerned with the kingdom's politics and military campaigns against the friends in the Baltic Sea than with the affairs of the church. It is from his time, the problems in Skåne begin to appear more concrete. The creation of a large number of important institutions in Skåne such as the archipelago, the monastery foundations and also the development of the cities, had obviously meant a great asset to the landscape. But the promoters may not always have the best of the landscape in mind. In the institutions themselves, there was a prominent opportunity for power and mastery of a particularly desirable landscape.

Of all the men whom we know by name, and who have hitherto been more active in Skåne in the past, none were born there. They originated either from Jutland or, especially during Absalon's and King Valdemar's time, from Zealand. During Absalon's time, a Scanian animosity towards the selfish government was also expressed directly. This happened in the context of a clash between the people of the archbishop and the king on the one hand and the other Scanian peasants in the early 1180s. The reasons for this were several. One can see from Skåne a dissatisfaction with the constant management discharge for the Vendor trains, further knotted over the bishopric and Absalon's demands on the celibacy of the priests. All things had been topical already during Eskil's time, but he had proceeded cautiously and, moreover, had no support from a strong royal power. The new and brusque demands made the Scanian chiefs and peasants rise. These Scanian large farmers seem to have been partly different from the western Danes. They had not yet reached the same reputation and prominent position in Danish national politics as for example. the rare White descendants. The Scanian big farmers must have lived for a much longer time in late Viking traditions and safeguarded their own local freedom. On the other hand, they had made good use of the assets of the international cultural institutions transplanted around the landscape, each within their area. Such a, admittedly hypothetical but likely location,

The Scanian peasants, to the outside, looked defeated, but they were never oppressed. However, the Zealand gentlemen were able to continue to build new churches in the landscape and to enrich the province with associated images and at the same time to manifest their claims. When the murder of Thomas Becket was made only twenty years after it took place on a Scanian baptismal font, it is probably not only the saint as such who is glorified but also the bishop with the rightful demands. Since the baptismal font is located in a church, Lyngsjö, which in several respects appears to have been erected by a man of the rare family to which the archbishop belonged, Absalon's consciousness seems to be in the open. His participation in another church building in the same area, N. Åsum, has been documented in the old way with a runestone erected at the church.

Admittedly, the Scans got the feel of Absalon's regiment, and he was primarily a national politician, but as such he succeeded under the kings Valdemar I and his son Knut VI to achieve fruitful cooperation between the church and the state, a collaboration that also came through the archdiocese in the long run Skåne for good. Not only the archbishop and the individual chiefs, but also the peasants in the parish community, during this time, seem to have conducted a very lively church building activity, ie a replacement of the old wooden churches with stone churches, which indicates that during this period the landscape benefited from a growing economic development. However, the direct spiritual cultivation had not been disadvantaged by Absalon, although he did not continue his representative's intense monastic founding. However, a significant monastery founded Absalon in Skåne, namely the Benedictine Nunnery in Bosjö. Moreover, he achieved a reform and uniformity of the Danish church.

When Absalon died in 1201 he was succeeded by Andreas Sunesen. This the last in the line of the four first and great archbishops of the puffin pen has gone to history as the most learned of the four. He had laid the foundation for studies in Paris, Bologna and Oxford. To give the future priests, who received their education in Lund, some of the knowledge that could be obtained at the foreign universities, he wrote a great poem on hexameter. With the creation story as a counterpoint point, this Christian story of salvation was depicted and commented upon. Andreas Sunessen's legal education, obtained in Bologna, was of great benefit in an important redrafting and commentary on the Skåne Act, through which we get a concrete picture of the life of the Scanian farmer.

During the final stage of Andreas Sunesen's archbishop, a new monastic order came to Skåne. As early as 1223, a place was educated for the Dominicans in Lund, from where they then spread to other cities. The introduction of different monastic orders during these times can be seen as a kind of reflection of the expanding cultural influences and the needs that have arisen through social development. The arrival of the beggar monks stands here as the end of the era in which we devote our interest. Their presence meant that a developed urban system had been reached. The reason for this was laid in Skåne already 200 years earlier with Lund, which later in the 1000s was followed by other inland cities such as Tommarp and Vä and Hälsingborg at the narrowest part of the strait.

Among these, Skanör and Falsterbo, located on a nose farthest to the southwest, came to occupy a special position, initially and not primarily as direct urban formations, as life here was relatively seasonal, but as a major international marketplace in the important trade in herring. . For a couple of months every year, merchants gathered here to receive the goods that really come along the coast of Skåne in exchange for their own products. Among the foreign-cooperating foreigners, from the end of the 12th century the Germans from the newly formed Hansa League came to be in the majority. German impulses also negatively affected the development of the organized urban system, which became characteristic of the High Middle Ages, and which began in Skåne during the last half of the 13th century.

With what these cities and their bourgeoisie came to represent, something new was introduced into social life alongside the old peasant society. But all this had been prepared during the last century, which, just by being a period of renewal, was constantly evolving, in all respects came to be both economically and culturally one of Skåne's foremost heyday. Basically, development had been fueled by the old peasant society, which despite strong influence from the continent never developed into a feudal society. The free peasants had felt the same way as the gentlemen, and the freedom consciousness, which may have once expressed itself in self-doubt, had under the influence of Christian institutions been given a new direction and a new responsibility.

In its relation to reality and the things and images that reflected this, the people of this society must have had a more unrestrained and less formally bound attitude than would follow in the coming more bourgeois society. The dependence on things, not the growth of the soil in the rhythmically changing nature, eventually brought to the citizen that he preferred to see himself and his surroundings depicted according to the picture of reality which was clearly tangible. The preceding expansive age usually did not bind the notions of sensual reality in an accepted or given form. Thus, in its visual art, the current world of imagination could be captured in a diverse diversity, reflecting both deep spirituality and naïve justice.

It was within and adjacent to the church that most of the monumental visual art was added throughout the Middle Ages. This is especially valid for the older part of the era, which is also relevant in this context. The connecting link with an older and pre-Christian tradition, which can and should have existed in e.g. sculpted parts of the old wooden churches, for the sake of Skåne, on an exception when completely wasted. So it is with the new stone church buildings that the sculpted image appears. Most of these churches, by comparison, were erected in Skåne during the 12th century and are still preserved for hundreds of years.

To build a stone church at this time would have been quite expensive. Nor should there be any doubt that the first and, even in the future, the most important initiatives were based on the great men who seized the economic opportunities. These then considered themselves to some extent the owners of the church building itself but at the same time also as a patron and defended by the same. This building's proprietary status was often manifested by the powerful west towers, which were as much the symbol of power as practical building elements, in which, among other things, patronus' special lodge was accommodated. But we can also note from the very design of the buildings that even the peasants of the congregation began to build their churches early themselves. The church building as well as the sculptural decoration were significantly benefited by the fact that Skåne has a rich natural supply of precious stone material in the sand and limestone quarries that have been used since the 11th century. It is almost exclusively in this material, mainly sandstone, that the presented sculptures are made.
