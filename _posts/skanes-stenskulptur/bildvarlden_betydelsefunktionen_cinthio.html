It would seem natural that baptism was of fundamental importance in people's religious views during a time when Christianity was relatively young and when the struggle with pagan powers was still alive. Here we see the explanation that such a rich artistic activity has been expressed in the adornment of the many baptismal finds with their diverse and intensely engaging visual world. We can hardly conclude that many of the heinous animals on the bases of the font represent the powers of evil, though other fonts in similar places may have been adorned with heavenly representatives. The fauna and life that develops here for our eyes are difficult to interpret in many respects, and many figures may forever be ruining their secrets.

We seem to encounter more easily understandable representations on the font's cupola. In most cases they are understandable in their details, but we want to know what they intend to shape.

All of the scenes depicting Jesus' baptism in the Jordan River are an easy-to-understand representation of the historical prototype of baptism. In Bjäresjö church, however, one encounters a picture of baptism, which goes completely beyond the historical depiction. Jesus sits in a lime-shaped baptismal font and holds in his right hand a cross. On his right is John the Baptist and on his left the Virgin Mary, holding something that should be interpreted as a long wax candle. Here is depicted not only baptism but also the death of the cross and with the light, the sign of the Easter liturgy, the resurrection to heavenly paradise, which is summarized in the rosette above Christ's head. Here, it is not primarily a matter of remembering a biblical event without pondering a mystery - that through baptism we must die to be resurrected with Christ.

We are constantly confronted with this concentrated symbolism in the consideration of the oldest medieval images. Clearly and expressively, the events of the Thursday night are rolled up for our glances at the fun in Löderup, but when the portrayal arrives at the culmination of events, we see a picture that is no longer narrative in a positive sense but which in itself has accumulated a meaning beyond time and space. The cross hovers over Calvary, it is carried in the rounds by the figures who at one time represent the four evangelists and their testimonies, as well as the four beings who will appear with Christ upon his return. The individual's participation with Christ is represented by Longinus, who, having strung up the side of Christ with his lance, was struck by the flowing blood and water - the water of baptism.

In a few places and for a few times, the artists in an immediate and dignified form have succeeded in rendering their belief in a mysterious affinity, shaped by the concrete story, existential first names in the sacramental affiliation and standing under the sign that will also form the final completion of baptism, Christ's return in His Majesty over the throne already prepared for Him.

The faithful Christ is a main motif found on a number of points and shows the symbolism of baptism in an eschatological context. This is a typical feature of the sacramental symbolism of the older Middle Ages, which often leaves parts of the doctrine of salvation in relation to the comprehensive whole, depicted figuratively by the final return of Christ. The possibility of resurrection, of which it was baptized, may become part of this occasion, we may find expressed by the person who, on the basis of the point in Saxtorp, raises his hands to the Christ-image which was probably originally found above, but which through the turning of the coupe has come to another place.

As common as it is to find ample elements of often difficult-to-understand symbolic representations within the older groups of func- tions, just as often the younger ones encounter a seemingly more uniform and more easily understood picture world. This certainly does not mean that the images, if not direct representations of the baptism, would lack a symbolic connection to the same. The frequently occurring presentations from Jesus' birth history are an example of this. Certainly, the pictures were intended to be a direct reminder of the mysteries of Christmas, but their intimate connection with the baptismal font should primarily be seen in the background of the notion of baptism as a rebirth. This rebirth of the individual is through participation in Christ, and in a simple and tangible way, this participation with the help of the image has been linked to Jesus' own birth. In the same way, we may find the dual task of the images depicting scenes from the creation story. Earlier it was talked about how not least these perhaps through their formal character, through the identification should have been able to establish a tangible contact between the spectator and themselves. But ultimately, this contact should lead to an awareness that creation here stands as a symbolic reference to the creation to new life through which baptism works. through the identification should have been able to establish a tangible contact between the spectator and themselves.

But it is not only the characters who narrate with the help of the figures who shape the symbolic thought which is related to the sacrament of baptism. Even the only ornamentally adorned ones can be covered with such references. Palmettes and bows have certainly come not only to adorn the cupolas. Their significance for the heavenly paradise may have been forgotten by the Convention afterwards, but it must have been originally acknowledged. Yes, maybe the four-wheeled wheel, which we find at a funt, is a direct reference to the four paradise rivers, which in the baptismal symbol are directly associated with the baptismal water. In many cases, the four animal or human heads found on the bases may also be interpreted in this direction. That the sculptural image world on the bases of the characters has not always embodied the defeated evil is clear from figures, who are unambiguous representatives of prominent persons in the heavenly paradise. We find Abraham with the Blessed in his care, Mary as the chief intercessor for the child she holds in her lap, and the apostles Peter and Paul.

However, it is not just the theological-symbolic depth of mind that is expressed in the visual world. We can possibly see a contact with the human conditions established by the manifestations of a partly "propagandistic" character. The saint legend in Tryde may have such a task in religious terms, the murder of Thomas Becket in addition to a political backbone, and the frequent occurrence of Peter in Christ's immediate presence with a religious-political allusion.

Of this rare wealth of motives and varying expressions in connection with a single object type, the font, we get an indication of the then conception of baptism as something extremely important. Not only with the basic meaning it has in conventional Christian view, but in addition also as a purely materialized sacramental act, by which the whole person was united not only in spiritual but also in bodily sense with Christ, the new ruler, to whom also the king devoted his tribute. and worship, when he so shone.

The church building was not, in the Middle Ages, not merely a place of worship but a dwelling place of God, which thereby became a symbol of heavenly Jerusalem. For this, Christ is the gate, and consequently the entrance to the church could also refer to Christ. This could be done in various forms directly or with reference to different beliefs, which would awaken the incumbent to the awareness of a position in the fight for the good. It is for this reason that the earliest architectural sculpture is primarily trained in and around the portal.

Around the portals of many of the continental large church buildings one often finds the whole symbolic dialectic expressed in many times elegant but sometimes almost coolly intellectual ways. But where do you find the central Christian mysteries concentrated with such simplicity and immediate human eagerness as in the tympanum field across the portal to the small early medieval church in Linderöd, in the middle of the forest of central Skåne. Against a moving and to some extent chaotic mills, Christ appears as the crowned king. He rules from the cross that he stands in front of. He is the gate, but precisely because of all that is going on around him. In the left corner we find the birth and in the right the defeated satan, defeated by the cross, from which Christ here arises and returns to separate the evil from the good on the last day. Faced with this eschatological vision, the viewer is faced with the hope of being on the right side of Christ with, among other things. a. the bishop, who resurrects his praise with the gesture that accompanies the praise of praise in the Mass.

In most cases, the tympanum field has stood with a representation of Christ among the apostle priests, Christ as Agnus Dei or represented by his Old Testament prototype Samson, or symbolic animal images, which no longer appear to have the direct aim of the portal's significance, as stated above. When two grapples on a tympanum in Gråmanstorp extend towards a tree in the middle, it can be the soul longing for the fruits of the tree of life. Across the opposite portal to the south, two large animals with a leash have been tied to the trunk of the tree, and from the mouths of the animals are plant vines. Here they have become part of the life-giving tree, which, from originally standing in the Garden of Eden, has become the cross of Christ to finally symbolize Christ Himself. This positive interpretation is not as easy to apply to the common motifs of the great lion, which devours an animal or a human. Is it evil that warns the incoming, or is it Christ in the likeness of the lion that defeats Satan? The question may be left unanswered, as in cases where a lion from a portal scope carries a human head between its opened jaws. Is it the devil who devours a man with holes and hair, or is it the realm of death that resurrects a soul?
