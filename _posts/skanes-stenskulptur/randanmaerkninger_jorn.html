Good art is always national.
National art is always bad
*Harald Giersing*

Just as the framework of ancient civilizations is being broken today to give way to a world culture, the same thing is happening in art. From the one-sided pursuit of European art and European artistic vision, what has been called modern art development has opened up to a universal art vision that contradicts a world art and to the extent that one could wish to extend Giersing's thinking and find that good art is always universal, but universal art is always bad. By the latter is meant the cosmopolitanism that deliberately installs itself as being universal.

If Nordic art was European in its entirety then this series of art books would have long since been published. But now the relationship is that it owns a dual being that is both European and not European. The difficulty lies in clarifying its relationship with, on the one hand, the European and, on the other, the universal in its being. If the European view of art was chosen as a gauge of value, then this art would simply appear as a subordinate peripheral species of an art development whose center begins in the Mediterranean. This has been unsuccessfully attempted. But if you chose the opposite, and claimed a completely isolated and absolutely independent Nordic art development, then this would again at best be reduced to a poor presentation, and at worst be a fraud. We must remain in the tension between the universal, the Nordic and the European throughout our description, and it is this difficult art that I hope to be able to successfully practice in the hope of giving a new grant to the world of art.

If one wants to reach a final crucial distinction of the object of one's examination, it is first necessary to possess a number of instruments capable of working with the sharpest precision. The words are the instruments by which one describes. To seem precise, the words must cover a unambiguous meaning, what one calls a term. Therefore, for the sake of a good result, we need to clarify certain basic concepts for our work, where these are taken in their most pointed sense.

The view of art that we have inherited from the Latin-European cultural circle, which until a hundred years ago was the dominant one, is taken from the view of political, social and cultural phenomena based on literary historicalism. Classical writing of history in the strictest sense, and this also applies to art history, bases its investigations on the contemporary records of historical events in relation to which the substance is explained. In this way, the substance is not only bound to certain events, but is also explained from the places and times, from the viewpoints from which contemporary history writing has taken place. Until Saxo Grammaticus wrote his Danish history, typically in Latin, only the Greeks and Romans wrote history, also about Scandinavia.

If this material is used as the basis for a Nordic history of art, it will emerge as a provincial and meaningless species of South-East European and Oriental art flows without active influence on ordinary art development in Europe. But the concept of provincialism itself makes no sense whatsoever if one does not agree that the essentials of art at any given time take place in particular radiation centers. The fact that such radiation centers actually exist and can form the basis for a coherent explanation of art development does not prevent other modes of description from being possible and fruitful.

No one would think of calling the South Sea Islands art provincial. Should this word have a precise meaning, it must cover a peripheral enterprise as part of a centralized economic, technical and social entity, of a state formation such as the Romans. The contradiction here is clear between the provincial-Roman art and the Nordic in the period of migration.

In the last century, as a counterpart to the theory of provincialism in European unity, nationalism was also resumed as an artistic value. With the nation-state, however, the contradiction between the capital and the province was merely achieved by contradiction within the national framework. It is typical for the Nordic countries that the most universally tuned artists and writers during this period were increasingly opposed to the capitals. It is in this spiritual homeland movement, a rejection of the contradiction between national and European, that this work has its richly worked foundation.

Classical history writing must give up where there are no literary sources in relation to which it can unfold its subject. Since virtually all of the area we are addressing here is strictly ahistorical, it is necessary to treat it on the basis of completely different principles, methods and structures. Over the last hundred years, these have accumulated in the science known as archaeology. Literary history writing explains the memories of the past from the sources written. Archeology writes its history directly from conclusions about the inner context of the ancient monuments itself, and thus follows the inverse interaction. History writing is an intermediary between art and science. Archaeology cannot afford to be. On the other hand, archeology remains hypothetical in its combinations of phenomena, where literary history allows itself to be asserted and pinned down, though as an expression of the interests underlying the desire to preserve the account of a particular event seen with particular eyes. If archaeological scientists agree on the authenticity of a foundation, if this contradicts written accounts, then the latter are considered false or distorted, since the object does not have the same opportunity to lie as the word.

Incidents and occurrences are the focal points of literary history. But these can never have any clear archaeological meaning. Archaeological research can clarify time, place and species, but is in itself an eventless shadowland. The incidental connection to literary historical writing places Nordic art in a peculiar half-light, where fragments appear here and there, and incidentally leaves the observer to fantasize about the rest. These are the conditions under which these books must necessarily be assembled.

The context that archaeology can provide is based on the study of the evolution of the most normal types, that is, the repetition of uniformity and variation. Using this material, the chronological order of time as well as the geographical movements in space can be described and assembled into stratigraphic overall images. Where an object cannot be inserted in a traditional course, it must be labeled as an archaeological foreign object until the context in which it naturally fits has been found.

Now, it is simply unfortunate that the artistic experience, which must be the purpose of the publication of art books, can have only a very limited interest in the main subject of archeology; yes because the artistic experience lies precisely in the encounter with the unique and the extraordinary, can be directly distracted by the archaeological major in its relation to the normal and typical. This means that the archaeologists who write these art books are forced to place themselves outside their central subject area to give us precisely the information we need here for purely artistic reasons.

Where the archaeologist compiles his material is to gain and clarify the recognition of a deeper historical context. Of course, this cannot be the purpose of art books, which must seek to emphasize the particular artistic value and being of the individual object itself.

When, with a certain serenity, I dare make this supreme requirement for Nordic archaeologists, I take pride in the knowledge that there is already such an extensive archaeological literature prepared by the Nordic researchers in our field that it is possible for them everywhere as well to satisfy the urge for a knowledge that is not directly tied to the immediate archaeological methodology.

Instead of inventing an imagined art history of literary touch, we have then attempted to produce a divided collaboration between a purely artistic approach to the subject through poetry, image choice and set-up, and a purely scientifically justified text to achieve Synthesis through this collaboration.

The tradition-based repetitions, which are usually called culture, turn into unbearable emptiness and monotonous routine, if they are not discouraged through the changing wealth of art. This inner contradiction between art and culture creates the latent tension of the substance we have here for us. This tension was abolished in the Greco-Roman cultural circle, which formed the basis for the civilization of modern industrial cities by dissolving the link between the standardized stereotype of practical production and the isolated work of art. From this endeavor, the corresponding classical aesthetic, which sees and describes the work of art in "splendid isolation", was designed as an independent formal whole. This aesthetic is also useless as a yardstick for Nordic art, where art is absorbed in social, practical and human functionality, as a kind of spiritual accompaniment to life. The task of isolating the individual artwork from the typological, the traditional and the functional can therefore here never be absolute if the picture is to be truthful.

The breakthrough of industrialism in the early part of the last century was aided by the classic aesthetic, which has increasingly isolated the world of art from its practical and technical development. But it seems to me that these developments today have reached such a high degree of perfection that one begins to appreciate art forms with a more intimate connection to life, without having to risk an attack on the independence of art. An issue that sets one or the other of these art forms as the highest or the lowest today seems rather useless. It answers questions as absurd as the problem of whether an hour is worth more than a meter. Instead of the traditional hierarchy of values ​​that arises in this area by a rather superficial simplification,

Thus, when it is the archaeological method followed in this series of books, it is not because of a special sympathy for traditionalism in art, but on the basis of a purely factual acknowledgment that it is the only scientific foundation that can be laid for an exploration of this more or less ahistorical art. When the Nordic art development is so suitable for an explanation through archaeological typology that it is the Nordic research that has built up the first basic elements of this science, it is primarily because Scandinavia has never held a provincial position in relation to to foreign superpowers, and never since the Stone Age has been subjected to immigrant people who could form new and more complex social changes.

This is again because it is a new and inhospitable country that first emerged from the ice sheet ten thousand years ago, and therefore must be regarded as the youngest country with the oldest people in Europe. Just as much havoc the Scandinavians are said to have made in other countries' historical course, equally stagnant and uneventful in relation to the great upheavals elsewhere, life seems to have progressed in this harsh climate, from which a stream of people spread to such an extent; that Tacitus referred to it as a human uterus. It is this barbaric view of the Norse people that we will seek to change through this work.

Precisely the close connection between art and culture has produced in the Nordic countries what one can call a fine artistic culture, a great appreciation of art, what one can see from the many smaller-sized art objects brought from abroad by foreign people in prehistoric times, and in between even a Chinese Buddha figure has found its place. In the same way, one must explain the overwhelming amounts of domestic artistic memories that have been preserved and protected in Scandinavia, of which the reproductions in this series are just a part. As easy as one can underestimate the artistic culture, however, it is equally easy to overestimate the one that is particularly inclined to in Scandinavia and the United States, for the artistic culture is not at all about the creative artist, nor the artistic creation process. It is purely a cultivation in the fussy unit of artistic enjoyment, of the demands of art, but is barren indeed and can be directly hostile to any artistic renewal. The artistic culture in the Nordic countries is therefore difficult to find expression in the artistic process of creation in the Nordic countries. The folk tale of the artist troll Fin originated in Old Norse mythology and expresses a typical situation in Nordic art development. Whether this is a real shortcoming or advantage should be left unsaid. The great efforts of Northern European scientists and collectors in the art of Mediterranean art are certainly an extremely positive result of this love of art. but being barren yes can be directly hostile to any artistic renewal.

Unfortunately, whether art-theoretical historism is formalistic as in Lionello Venturi's principles or symbolistic as in Irwin Panofsky's iconology, it unfortunately always ends up in an attack on contemporary art, because it fails to meet the values ​​norms that history finds in the past and is considered by many to be eternally valid . Some call them objective.

It seems to me to be a logical conclusion that an art conception that needs to systematically disprove its contemporary art a value in order to assert itself, thereby necessarily revealing a misjudgment or restriction, which must also take into account the material that is assessed by theory highest.

A progressive development of the Nordic art vision, as will be revealed as this series of books is available, will, if I hope not come to shame, be able to fill the gap in the artistic description that these two excellent theorists have been forced to leave alone to be able to shape their discipline within a coherent logic. As a starting point for such a third art exhibition complementary to these, I intend to use the considerations of Danish art historian Julius Lange. I hope through this grant to the theory of art to reach a theoretical affirmation also of the free artistic expression today and into the future, and to reach a realization of the efforts by which Whistler in his time fruitioned the modern art development.

There was a break in the development of art when we came to the phenomenon that is usually referred to as modern art, and which first completely and completely broke through with Whistler and the Impressionists. From the belief that art has its purpose in itself, and in nothing but itself, art is thereby liberated as an independent enterprise from its serving social, political, historical, scientific and technical function.

In this development, so far, all emphasis has been placed on the release of the artwork as an independent object or on the artist as an independent personality. But it seems to me that both of these liberations simply lead to the isolation and increasing struggle of the artist and the artist, where an empty play of formal technique or the tragic fate of the individual becomes the sole content of art, unless a third side of this liberation is emphasized. But this requires understanding a distinction between what one calls the purpose and what is the end goal. If art is its own end goal, then it can never have a purpose to strive for, not even itself. But if art has no purpose in itself, this does not prevent many non-artistic companies from seeking its purpose in art.

If you say that art does not have its ultimate goal in itself, but in the end is the end goal of all human enterprise but not its purpose, then you simply express the provable fact expressed in the words Ars longa, vita brevis. If art becomes the purpose of life, the meaning of life itself is reduced to the preparation of an immortal memorial. If, on the other hand, you perceive art as a form of life in accordance with Johannes Holbek, then the art itself contains a life requirement, then the art that is spoken of in "The Speech of the High" is the aftermath that never dies. If the work of art is thus a Nordic way of life, then it is also a form that only reveals its truth in the moment it has engulfed the life that has created it, which thus prevents the opportunity to appreciate an artistic development until that moment. this is stopped and executed. Nowhere in the world does one know such a respectful and absolutely neutral waiting attitude towards the artistic process as in the Nordic countries. Therefore, whether it is a gift immersed in the darkness of the moss or rendered on high as in ancient times or created in modern settings, it is characterized by an irrevocable act of sacrifice, which is why no account can be made, of a meaningless surprise to which we has no other expression than what one calls the gift of grace, which, in its heavy and clumsy manner, expresses what one can, in Southern ease, unite in the concept of grace. There must be three of them. We already know the two. This is the third we have now started hunting. be it a gift immersed in the darkness of the moss or made high as in ancient times or created in modern settings, characterized by an irrevocable act of sacrifice, why no account can be made, of a meaningless surprise to which we have no other expression than what one calls the gift of grace, which, in its heavy and clumsy way, expresses what can be reconciled in the concept of grace in southern ease.
