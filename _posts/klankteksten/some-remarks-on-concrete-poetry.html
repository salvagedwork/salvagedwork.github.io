in the overall picture, the manifesto's of the fifties, the tentative anthologies, exhibitions and essays of the sixties, in their efforts to delineate, to collect and to describe what concrete literature, resp. concrete poetry actually is, present a plenty of not only terminological differences and blurred notions, well before and concurrent with the rather belatedly accredited term 'concrete literature', we meet with such expressions (often used either synonymously or but slightly varying in meaning) as 'elementary', 'abstract', 'absolute', 'material literature' with mostly striking parallels in a so-called literary revolution, time and again, the terms concrete and visual poetry are used as synonyms, whereas visual and phonetic poetry are clearly differentiated, and while heissenbüttel views the concept concrete poetry as coined on the pattern of concrete art, fahlström, in his manifesto, employs the term concrete rather 'as relative to concrete music than to concretism of imagery'.

in the face of this dilemma, schmidthenner resignedly admits that the authors of concrete poetry only concur in that they insist that 'what is materially concrete in language should be incorporated in the production of literature' but otherwise agree to differ widely as to 'what should, still or already, be considered as coming in the pale of concrete poetry'. i believe, however, that, in a broader perspective, farther reaching aspects may be gained, when we are prepared to conceive of literature as a process of which concrete literature is in fact but a phase; and that, by attempting to understand concrete literature from its historic roots, we may find access to it in a meaningful way.

the manifesto's of the fifties dealing with concrete literature concur in stressing that the literary product is a primarily linguistic happening; they aim at excluding all that is subjectively incidental, oppose traditional habits of writing and reading, call for new modes of writing and reading, and view, with max bill, the literary product as an object for intellectual use. in his vision, bill refers, by and large, to an art that in its self-awareness - in order to answer the definition 'concrete' - should be dated not later than 1930, i.e. following the publication of the first and only issue of van doesburg's magazine 'art concret'. like various other manifesto's of the mid-and late twenties, the 'manifesto of concrete art' as published in this issue, does not formulate a new beginning but presents a systematic review of the various individual achievements of the artistic revolution, whether the notion 'concrete', relating to plastic art, was used before 1930, cannot be conclusively substantiated; is, however, highly probable.

in the present state of research, it is deemed unlikely that the term 'concrete poetry' was already current usage at such an early date, yet a retrospective essay by arp, 'kandinsky, Ie poète' (1951), published prior to the early manifesto's of fahlström and gomringer, includes some revealing clues: 'in 1912 i visited with kandinsky in munich. (...) it was the time in which abstract art started its transformation into concrete art. (...) in the year of dada, poems by kandinsky were read for the first time in cabaret Voltaire in Zürich (...). the dadaists were fervent protagonists of concrete poetry, in 1916, hugo ball and tristan tzara wrote onomatopoeic poems that have substantially contributed to bringing concrete poetry into clear focus, my volume of poems 'die wolkenpumpe' contains mainly concrete poems, kandinsky's body of poems 'klänge' is one of the outstanding great books. (...) in these poems, there are sequences of words and sentences (...) that (...) remind the reader of the continuous flux and birth of things, often with a vein of dark humor and, what is characteristic of concrete poetry, non-didactic, in one of goethe's poems, the reader is alerted, in a poetic manner, to the fact that man must die and be reborn, kandinsky, on the other hand, confronts the reader with a dying and resuscitating word image, a dying and resuscitating word order (...).' meaningful in this respect is that arp sets goethe's poem against that of kandinsky, the poetically didactic poem against the linguistic manifestation, the symbolic against the concrete poem, one might stretch this statement by saying that just as goethe, in formulating his idea of the symbol, offsets the symbolic manner of speech, as truly poetic, against the allegorical parlance (of the 18th century), arp contrasts the concrete mode of expression with the symbolic parlance (of the 19th century), as a case in point: goethe's symbolic poem 'wanderers nachtlied' (über allen gipfeln), resp. its dialectic inversion in brecht's 'lithurgie vom hauch', is superseded in concrete literature by gomringer's one-word constellation 'schweigen', resp. achtleitner's linguistic demonstration of restlessness ('ruh und'), the beginnings of concrete literature date indeed back to the literary confrontation with a traditionally symbolic mode of expression, this may be exemplified by works of the other exponents mentioned by arp, ball and tzara, in the field of phonetic poetry as well as by arp's own poems, in many ways similar to kandinsky's 'klänge', so much admired by arp, they bespeak the confrontation by their linguistic and verbal playing with literary ingredients, by converting sense into nonsense, eventually, they lead, beyond this toying with colloquial language, to the tryout of new linguistic devices, to the innovation of novel syntactic forms (e.g. permutation), to the initiation of a new way of speaking in the poem, e.g. in the 'konfigurationen', resp. 'konstellationen' of 1930.

it is not just accidental that in the line of ancestors of concrete literature, the name of apollinaire figures, his much quoted 'il pleut', still fully steeped in the tradition of symbolic imagery, takes a traditional lyrical image literally and externalizes it, as it were, in the typogram, other 'calli-grammes' of his hand evince - e.g. by the pointed introductions of colloquial props -a progressive erosion of the symbolic imagery, when, in the late fifties, the noigandres group finally calls for the suppression of all metaphoric approximations, it marks the end of a process, sparked by apollinaire and others, in which, in keeping with concrete literature, the traditional literary image was superseded by the extra-linguistic, f igurate relationship, the typographic model, the multitude of resulting possibilities reveals itself in a gamut ranging from near tautologies (when kolar organizes the letters of the name albers into albers-squares) to the intended contradiction of typographical image and text (when bremer inscribes words of the sermon on the mount in the picture of two tanks).

crucial to this figurate typography is the demand voiced by the italian futurists of the 'parole in libertà': that the text be liberated from its traditional left-to-right sequential flow, a freedom which opens up the possibility of positioning signs, syllables, sounds, words and groups of words freely over the page, the call for the disruption of traditional syntax has assigned part of the role and function of established syntax to typography; it has inaugurated in literature, as it were, a typographic syntax, accordingly, the role of italian futurism has been of major importance in the early history of concrete literature in which moreover, through the personality of marinetti's disciple and protégé belloli, it flows out almost without transition.

the 'parole in libertà' have been criticized as being disruptive for form and content, what the critics do not sufficiently realize is that their call for freedom sprang from the confrontation with a literature that was irretrievably anchored in the category of content, the concept of form as a traditional poetic entity, the duality of form and content, style and quality, heissenbüttel - whose line of thought i largely adopt - has qualified this confrontation as a process of reduction of the content and liquidation of the form in their traditional manifestations, and has come to the conclusion that, in the thus effected reduction and back-orientation of language itself, the issue of form and content has become irrelevant, meaningless.

what heissenbüttel, on this score, illustrates with texts of gertrude stein, another exponent of concrete literature, i.e. reduction to the variation of a model, is further conclusive evidence of concrete texts, one might, for instance, organize the purely formal setup of an exhibition in such a way that the number of words that go into the making of the text, decreases progressively, until eventually the text consists of just one single word; this gomringer once called the ideal concrete poem, one could, indeed, trace this process of reduction back beyond the word and show it up in all possible visual constellations of syllables or even mere letters, also in this field, yet another champion of concrete literature, kurt schwitters, in his so-called 'elementar-gedichte', has already come up with some exemplary reduction models and, with the free typography of his 'composed f igurate poem', has blurred the boundaries with plastic art. when, in 1960, heissenbüttel claims: 'reduction must engender wit', it obviously points to the danger of sterility, the eventuality of unimaginative playing with typographic forms, yet in his program he includes the joke or pun as an essential asset of the reduced textual, verbal or character model, this, indeed, is an inherent element of the works of f inlay and jandl.

but schwitters, although somewhat underrated as to his merits for the development of concrete literature, appears to be a 'witness for the crown' for yet another, wider aspect, i.e. for the increasing difficulty of discerning whether, in dealing with the numerous specimens of concrete literature, we are, in fact, confronted with poetry to be looked at or with pictures to be read, 'i have', he notes in 1921, 'pasted poems together from words and sentences in such a way that their rhythmic positioning represents a drawing, conversely, i have pasted together pictures and drawings so as to make sentences that must be read my object was to obliterate the boundaries between the various arts.'

a last significant 'witness for the crown' should be named here: stéphan mallarmé from whose 'un coup de dés' gomringer has derived the motto of his first manifesto. what karl einstein has formulated for mallarmé: that he was concerned with 'the difficult point where language can only justify its existence by being pinned down in the contrast of the written black and the virginal white of the paper' - this indeed is reflected in texts such as gomringer's 'das schwarze geheimnis', in numerous works of gappmayr and others, in this context, there is clearly a certain capacity for linguistic mysticism in some of the authors of concrete literature.

without going into a detailed inventory, the foregoing covers, in broad outline, the precinct of concrete poetry, nevertheless, the picture, it seems to me, justifies the statement that concrete literature can only be understood from its basis, from its historic origins, its break-away from 'the poetic structure that had existed for some hundred years', from 'the structural unity of modern european lyric poetry' much criticized by friedrich, occurred in its early days, whether concrete literature, as a form of poetry 'that does not deal with language as just an object, but wants language to speak itself', 'inaugurates not only a new but an ultimate phase in the formative history of poetry', as wagenknecht suggests, this question will perhaps be answered by the present exhibition of works of the last twenty years, in addition, it should also reveal whether the criteria found in the precinct of concrete literature, indeed lead to concrete literature or point to a development through and beyond it.
