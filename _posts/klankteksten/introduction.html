The exhibition 'Concrete Poetry ?' features over one hundred artists. The complexity of the setup required an exceptionally great organisational endeavour, for which homage is due to miss Liesbeth Crommelin, deputy-curator of the Museum's department of Applied Art. Apart from her study of the matter in hand and her untiring efforts, along with the devoted care of the secretariat which could hardly cope with the spate of poetic contributions, we were committed to advice and actual assistance from outside, which, in fact, has been extended to us in a generous and profuse manner. In various countries, our advisors have collected material for the benefit of the exhibition. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the following persons: 

Pierre Garnier, France
Haroldo deCampos, South-America
Reinhard Döhl, Germany
Bob Cobbing, England
Paul de Vree, Belgium and the Netherlands
Seiichi Niikuni, Japan
Bohumila Grögerova and Josef Hirsal, Czechoslovakia
Emmett Williams, USA
Hansjörg Mayer, Germany and England
Ugo Carrega and Sarenco, Italy
Michael Rhodes, Canada

In addition, as the preparatory operations proceeded, all kinds of new work were sent in; it was all viewed and graded during two strenuous weekends. During the stimulating discussions with Paul de Vree, Hansjörg Mayer, Bob Cobbing and Reinhard Döhl, the setup as well as the title of the exhibition were constantly subject to change and under fire of criticism. Bob Cobbing handled the material for the longplay record as well as the program for the tape recorders; Hansjörg Mayer consulted with general public.

In the Netherlands for one, which on the score of its limited language territory, finds itself from the start at a disadvantage, it has been possible since 1962 to get acquainted with the latest ideas on visual poetry, notably through the extremely well documented publications in the periodical De Tafelronde, published at Antwerp by Paul de Vree. There are in the Dutch language area in all some six magazines that are almost entirely committed to this visual aspect of poetry. In the official literary press in Holland, however, visual poetry is all but totally ignored; not until this year (1970), on the spur of the publication of some visual poetry in book form, did the literary columns of a few dailies and weeklies devote some more column space to this event. Could it be that we Dutchmen are by nature wary of amalgamating individual disciplines ? On surveying the international publications in this field, we are bound to recognize that we are here indeed concerned with a professional field, alas with the inevitable concommittant issues of birthright, confusion of ideas, etc. We have tried to be as objective as possible in our approach of the matter in hand, but realize full well that we have not been successful all the way. While, on the one hand, it was obvious that a movement which originated some twenty years ago, has by now become a closed historical chapter, on the other hand it seemed equally conceivable that its influence or aftereffect might evolve along entirely different lines according to tradition, personality or circumstances.
In the spring of 1970, Nicolas Zurbrugg collected, in the magazine Stereo Headphones, a number of stagements on the death of concrete poetry, as voiced by various well-known poets in this field. The opinions ranged from fierce attacks on those artists who continue to work on the old established lines and don't, in fact, achieve more than feeble typographical jokes, to the recognition of the 'death' of concrete poetry which would clear the road for the emergence of new forms in poetry.

What we have tried to visualize in the present exhibition, is

a.
the evolution of the new typovisual forms as from 1950;
b.
poetry which avails itself also of other plastic means than the printed (or typewritten) character.

The first section of the exhibition opens with the somewhat isolated figure of Carlo Belloli, disciple of Marinetti's, who constitutes in a way a transition from the futurist ideas to the 'concrete' thinking of around 1950. The second section shows the afore mentioned major influential groups and individuals who worked quite independently in various places. Next is shown, in a rather random order, work originated in a number of countries, in particular publications by people who have been creative in this field since before 1965. An exception has been made for Japan which country, on account of its fundamentally heterogeneous characters, was difficult to place in a chronological pattern, and also for Czechoslovakia which, as a result of its isolation, has produced work of such an individual character that it baffles all efforts to distinguish different periods.

The last section of the exhibition features artists who search for other than purely typographic means to make poetry 'concrete'. They include authors who either originally came under the first group but have changed their working methods afterwards or, from the start, used other formative means and who, in many instances, appear to think in terms of politico-social or philosophical ideas as is evidenced by a number of texts by Italian and French poets which share many properties with other forms of plastic art. A third group is formed by some of the latest examples of typovisual expression having an originality of their own and of their own time.

To the end of elucidating the didactic side of the exhibition, it was thought appropriate to open with a number of examples of working methods that visitors may identify in the exhibited texts. The grouping as shown in this opening section, has been derived, in a shorter version, from the exhibition Text Buchstabe Bild which was organized in Zürich this summer by Felix Baumann and Reinhard Döhl.

I have refrained from giving here a definition of what concrete poetry is, on the assumption that the essays by Bob Cobbing, Reinhard Döhl and Paul de Vree included in the catalogue, present an illuminating description of, respectively, its phonetic, its linguistic and its graphic-visual aspects.
